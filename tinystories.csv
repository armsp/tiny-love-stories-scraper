0,2021-05-04T19:00:07+0000,Still Cooking Side by Side,"I fry cutlets for chicken parmigiana, doing math: In my 53 years, I have fried thousands. My mother taught me. When I was 7, we would fry chicken side by side, her hip touching mine. “Cover yourself,” she would say. “You’ll get hurt and dirty that shirt.” As a teenager, I’d snap, “Ma, I hate when you use ‘dirty’ as a verb.” But, no matter the age, I would listen and grab an apron. More math: It’s been over two decades without her. But still, like magic, she reminds me to separate the cutlets and back away from the flame. — Kathy Curto",Kathy Curto
1,2021-05-04T19:00:07+0000,"A Silent, Shared Language","My abuela raised me, her first grandson, in Santiago in the 1970s, while my parents worked to support us. Then, when I was 6, we moved to Melbourne. I missed my abuela. When I was 15, she visited us in our new country, where she didn’t speak the language but still bargained at the market. At 24 and beginning law school, I returned to Santiago. My abuela cooked me lunch every day. A practicing lawyer at 40, I returned in time to say goodbye at her bedside. My family doesn’t say “I love you,” yet by my being there, I think she knew. — Miguel Belmar Salas",Miguel Belmar Salas
2,2021-05-04T19:00:07+0000,Miraculous in the Mundane,"My husband and I were 30 with three children under the age of 6 when we adopted a 16-year-old from foster care. Days were spent trying to be cool and strict and look like we knew what we were doing. Sleepless nights were spent recounting the day’s failures. But every morning we got up and did it again. Made mistakes. Laughed. Cried. Argued. Apologized. Prayed. Reminded Brandan to wear his retainer. Cheered for him at football games. Cut his hair in the garage. And, somewhere in the mundane, I became Brandan’s mother. And Brandan became my son. — Denise Kendrick",Denise Kendrick
3,2021-05-04T19:00:07+0000,Treasure Hunt,"In my 40s, I spent summers with my widowed mother in England. Before returning to New York, I would write playful notes and hide them around her house. Under the silver candlestick, she discovered: “The butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker — and your daughter — love you.” For weeks after I left, she would call and laugh. “I found another one of your little notes!” Cleaning out her house after she died, I found a box in her bedroom. Inside was every note I’d given her, organized by year — a gift she gave back to me. — Jennifer Fell Hayes",Jennifer Fell Hayes
4,2021-04-27T19:19:54+0000,Tito’s Trust,"Tito asked me to marry him, but not for the happily ever after. He had AIDS — a death sentence in the early 1980s. He wanted his property to go to his partner, Michael, but his father disapproved. After Tito’s death, I was to wait a few years, then sign everything over to Michael. I was honored by Tito’s trust and might have said yes, but his father relented, allowing Michael to inherit Tito’s assets, though he would not be invited to the funeral. Forty years later, I miss my friend. Would he be married to Michael if he were alive? — Lynn Tamayo",Lynn Tamayo
5,2021-04-27T19:19:54+0000,Maybe More Than Slightly,"“Why can’t you find someone?” my parents asked when I was 26. “He’s not here yet,” I said. “He’s in Africa.” (I’ve always been slightly psychic; my parents have always been slightly skeptical.) As the “Dating Diva” at Manhattan’s Learning Annex, I felt confident in my ability to help myself and others “find a mate or just a date.” In my 40s, I still felt confident but relied less on my “dating tricks.” One rainy night, I bumped into a tall man who rolled his R’s. Today, my South African husband says he loves me and our daughter in Afrikaans. — Estelle Erasmus",Estelle Erasmus
6,2021-04-27T19:19:54+0000,What Might Have Been,"We started dating a few months before the pandemic. She lived in New Jersey while I lived in New York, and she drove a dusty compact car. The back seat was like an Army surplus store: blankets, picnic chairs, snacks, water. She was a civil engineer and liked to be prepared. The first time we kissed was in her car, contorted across the front seats. I remember the scent of her shampoo, and the weight of everything behind us and the year ahead. The last message I received from her was: “The pressure is too high, I can’t. I’m sorry.” — Rahul D’Silva",Rahul D’Silva
7,2021-04-20T19:03:49+0000,What I Want to Remember,"I started cleaning our apartment so I could take photos to remember it by. My husband was retiring, and we were moving from New York — leaving the place where two lonesome apartments combined into this one; where two single people combined as a pair; where I, at 63, had lived longest. What I really wanted was to remember our home in all its chaotic glory: open sardine tins, piles of papers and books. So I stopped tidying. You’d think this mess was caused by moving, but really it was created because we were living. — Jill Lipton",Jill Lipton
8,2021-04-20T19:03:49+0000,Blooming Still,"Unlike the other trees Nanima planted at our home in Pakistan, I dislike this mango tree. Mango trees mean mango bugs. Three years ago, one of the mango tree’s branches touched my bedroom balcony, allowing bugs to infest my space. “Those bugs, they petrify me!” I said. (Although an adult, I was a baby in front of Nanima.) The next morning, she cut her beloved tree’s branch. Only a grandmother can love like that. This is my first spring without her. The tree will blossom, the bugs will come, but I won’t have Nanima to hear and appease my fears. — Rasti Iqbal Jamil",Rasti Iqbal Jamil
9,2021-04-20T19:03:49+0000,My Only Lasting Satisfaction,"After four years of texting, we were finally going to meet. My father had died. On my way to my family in Venezuela, I stopped in Colombia, where my online lover lived. He had me at my most vulnerable. For three days, we loved intensely, making promises about marriage, dreaming of canary-yellow diamond rings. I left for work. Our dreams sustained me. Then we broke, and I broke too. My only satisfaction is the Pablo Neruda poem I left in his room. It reads: “Cuantas veces, amor, te soñé sin verte?” How many times, love, did I dream of you without seeing you? — Sebastian Cabrices",Sebastian Cabrices
10,2021-04-20T19:03:49+0000,In an Envelope,"In 2017, my friend since 1979 had spinal surgery. I stole time from my vigil to purchase a hospital coffee. Distracted, I left my purse behind, and it was stolen. Security insisted my wallet — with driver’s license, personal information and family pictures — would turn up. It did not. Weeks later, an envelope arrived at my former office at the University of Wyoming. Return address? None. Just: “Found Scattered on Street.” Contents: faculty ID, library card, a nearly empty gum packet, one stranger’s kindness and the warmth I feel for someone I have never met. — Pamela Galbreath",Pamela Galbreath
11,2021-04-13T19:00:06+0000,Waving From the Other Side,"On my father’s workdays, he would wait for me to wake. I would dress quickly, splashing water on my face. Leaving his scooter behind so we could talk along the way, he would speak of life, of love, both of us laughing; sometimes I would cry. “You’ll understand someday,” he would say when I searched his eyes for answers. A hug, then he would cross the busy street in Mombasa, Kenya. A smile in his eyes, he would stand on the other side and wave. I cherish this memory now that he has crossed over to life’s other side. — Derrick Ochieng",Derrick Ochieng
12,2021-04-13T19:00:06+0000,A Common Mark,"There are two countries with an “X” in their English names. John is a Luxembourger; I am Mexican. Born in countries with different cultures and climates, we have two distinct ways of seeing our world. Yet older love is special because life has already shown you who you are and how others have been shaped in ways you can’t always understand. I try to impress John with my high-school French. He tries to remember his high-school Spanish. We met after marriages, children and lives far from each other. But now we have marked each other’s hearts with an “X.” — Alejandra Garza",Alejandra Garza
13,2021-04-13T19:00:06+0000,Let’s Just Breathe,"Last month, the emergency room doctor sat on the edge of my bed and said, “I have three children. Do you know how many times I’ve been pregnant?” I shook my head. “Nine.” As she left, she added, “You will have a boy and a girl. I’ve been right about my last seven friends!” The tears came and I gasped for air. Ten months of trying had ended in unthinkable loss. My husband gently cupped my face and said, “All we have to do right now is breathe. Isn’t that a wonderful thing?” And with our foreheads together, we did just that. — Beth Kuhn Metzler",Beth Kuhn Metzler
14,2021-04-13T19:00:06+0000,‘Aren’t I So Lucky?’,"My family of four lives in San Francisco. In February, we had one of our first outings for pleasure since the pandemic began. At a stationery shop on Union Street, I was looking at greeting cards when Xavier, my 6-year-old, spontaneously declared, “I love you, Mommy.” The two store clerks at the counter paused what they were doing, then smiled as if embarrassed to be caught witnessing an intimate expression. To break the ice, I asked them, “Aren’t I so lucky?” Officially invited into our moment, they gladly agreed. — Debbie Dang",Debbie Dang
15,2021-04-06T19:00:08+0000,"Looking for Someone, Maybe You","My boss at the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS wanted me to meet Susan. He said that she, a hardworking designer, needed to get out more. Imagining that meant “couldn’t get a date,” I felt more resigned than happy. “How will I know you?” she asked over the phone. “I’ll be the 5-foot-9 woman who looks like I’m looking for someone.” She replied, “I’ll be the 6-footer looking for you.” Susan entered the Noho Star, now permanently closed, in a cloud of colorful fabric. I was agog, thinking, “I’m not introducing her to anyone.” I’m still agog. — Rosemary Kuropat",Rosemary Kuropat
16,2021-04-06T19:00:08+0000,When Snow Melts,"Wonder Woman’s eyes on my ninth grade journal elicit sharp memories. I purchased the notebook when I was 14, a new student in a new state. Hounded by an internal villain wielding a whip of self-doubt, I tried to emulate Wonder Woman’s strength. The pages describe a young dancer fearful of being “an ugly, stumbling little snowflake who you could miss in a blink.” Now, at 18, I look at the trees unfurling after a long New Hampshire winter. Though I have learned to appreciate snow, I am always grateful when it melts. And this is a story about spring. — Victoria Chen",Victoria Chen
17,2021-04-06T19:00:08+0000,"Oh Dearling, My Nar-Dar, Est-Est-Est!","Our terms of endearment have always evolved. Once, after a movie, “dear” and “darling” morphed into “dearling.” During lockdown in Prague, the evolution accelerated: “Darling” became “Dar-Dar,” then “Dar,” followed by “Nar-Dar” and “Nar,” and finally “Nar-Nar.” Meanwhile, “Dearling” transformed into “Dearlingest,” then “Est,” then “Est-est-est.” It makes sense: Working from home for a year and stuck in a second lockdown as the Czech Republic battles one of the world’s highest Covid death rates, we’ve had far more time together than usual. I just wonder: In what other ways has humanity evolved faster than usual this year? — Melody Rose McClure",Melody Rose McClure
18,2021-04-06T19:00:08+0000,Blowing in the Wind,"Recently we toasted with champagne in your newly purchased East London flat. Three years earlier, I watched your red nails scratch thin hospital sheets, brought you cans of Coca-Cola and coloring books after you tried to overdose. I have never been so relieved about a friend’s failure. On the first anniversary of your attempt, we traveled to Puglia, acquiring parking tickets at an alarming rate while enjoying gorgeous seaside towns. Friendships hold uncountable sorrows and joys, like toasting your new life or eating Ikea hot dogs in the store parking lot, our masks blowing like flags from our wrists. — Xan Pedisich",Xan Pedisich
19,2021-03-30T20:00:08+0000,"Our Seder, a Year Later","“Why is this night different from all the others?” Last Passover, there were more ways than usual. My father was hospitalized with low oxygen. My mother and sister, also sick, spent the holiday clutching their phones in case he called. I was with my partner, crying over chicken broth, gripped by fear. This year, I remember the virus that passed over my own blood, sparing my father as the Israelites were spared from the final plague. I find new meaning in “Dayenu,” a Seder song of gratitude with the refrain: “It would have been enough.” My family’s health will always be enough. — Amanda Glickman",Amanda Glickman
20,2021-03-30T20:00:08+0000,Sowing a Future,"Midway through 2020, I started planting seeds in my backyard. My daughter said, “You’ve wanted to do this for years. Do you like it?” “Yes,” I said. “I love it.” At the time, I didn’t realize I was growing more than tomatoes. Overwhelmed by the pandemic, my mother’s worsening dementia and the painfully quiet demise of a decades-long relationship, I was sowing a future. My head down and hands busy, I could hope. “You seem calmer even though everything is more difficult,” my daughter said. Yes. Planting new seeds is hard. Realizing old seeds are no longer growing is harder. — Karen Amster-Young",Karen Amster-Young
21,2021-03-30T20:00:08+0000,"Hello, Old Friend","Grief was that relative I heard stories about. I knew her in the way I knew Uncle Gerald, someone I never met but learned so much about. Then my husband died, and there Grief was, shaking my hand. I offered her the guest bedroom, scrambling to make it comfortable, but not too comfortable because I didn’t want her to stay long. Instead of the guest bedroom, she marched right into my bedroom and dropped her heavy bags. Years later, she’s still with me, now an old friend, someone to sip martinis with and remember. — Barbara Phillips",Barbara Phillips
22,2021-03-30T20:00:08+0000,Teacher of the Year,"In March 2009, two weeks after my students voted me teacher of the year, I learned I wouldn’t be returning to school after summer break. State budget cuts had threatened hundreds of thousands of public schoolteacher positions around the country. I finished the semester, teaching five high school Spanish classes with a total of 110 students. When they discovered that I wouldn’t be returning, a clandestine plan was set in motion. They surprised me, arriving at school wearing custom T-shirts that read “I support Ms. Minsky.” That expression of affection helped carry me through a dark time. — Connie Minsky",Connie Minsky
23,2021-03-23T19:00:07+0000,"My Mother, My Friend","My first semester of college, I only called my mother twice. At my house, I felt generally misunderstood and judged for my weight; at school, I was finally free. But the pandemic forced me home. I spent the first months in my room. Then, my mother and I started watching Chinese competition shows together, bonding over the contestants. Now I make sure she’s eating even when she avoids meals to stay thin. We converse in simple Mandarin, a language I hadn’t bothered to learn before. I buy her flowers and cry when I think of leaving her. — Annabelle Wang",Annabelle Wang
24,2021-03-23T19:00:07+0000,‘Love Endures Without Fresh Photos’,"I take a lot of photos. My house is filled with images of places I have visited and people I love. I rotate the photos, taking new ones, making more prints, slipping new pictures over old ones in frames. But I have realized, six months after my partner’s sudden death, that the photos I have of John are all I will ever have. So I conjure up memories of him — hiking in the Sierras, enjoying a party, reading at the kitchen table. Love endures without fresh photos, but oh how I miss stealthily snapping him. — Ellen Greenblatt",Ellen Greenblatt
25,2021-03-23T19:00:07+0000,Lean on Me (When You’re in Heels),"Our pace slowed as Monica’s feet started to hurt in her blue velvet heels. I was wearing sneakers and offered to switch. I stumbled along, leaning most of my weight on her shoulders. We only made it one city block before switching back. This wasn’t the first or last time she would prop me up as I floundered uncomfortable in femininity. Later she would help me change my legal name and gender marker. She still loves — and can rock — high heels. But next time the night gets long, I will probably offer a piggyback ride. — Nat Mulkey",Nat Mulkey
26,2021-03-23T19:00:07+0000,A Man Who’s Just Right,"From the back seat, my 5-year-old son, Jack, said: “Mommy, why don’t you have a boyfriend?” Freshly divorced and unsure how to answer, I asked why he asked. Jack replied, “Because you’re really nice. You should be with someone nice.” I realized the troubles of my previous marriage had not gone unnoticed. Jack said I should look for someone kind, respectful and of medium height — like Grandma. Eight years later, Jack calls my husband, Greg, “Dad.” I tease Greg that it’s a good thing that he’s on the shorter side, just like my mother. — Clara Koschnitzke Hoffmann",Clara Koschnitzke Hoffmann
27,2021-03-16T19:00:07+0000,I Guess I Passed Her Test,"As a dutiful girlfriend, I accompanied Arturo to J.F.K. Airport to pick up his sister, who was arriving from Buenos Aires. Greeting her, I casually asked what brought her to New York. “Mami sent me to check you out,” she said. Years later, Mami was visiting us. She offered to buy me a replacement diamond for the one that fell out of my engagement ring. “Oh, I can’t allow you to buy me something so expensive,” I said. Her reply? “Please do, because you are everything I hoped for in a wife for my son.” How could I refuse? — Phyllis Meyers",Phyllis Meyers
28,2021-03-16T19:00:07+0000,She’s Still With Us,"In February 2019, my youngest sister, Melina, admitted herself into the hospital for PTSD from childhood trauma. When she returned home, she texted, “Do not contact me ever again!” Determined to get through to her, I invited her to walk with me and Preston, my goldendoodle. She loved Preston but refused. In March, Melina died of suicide. On a walk the morning after her funeral, Preston suddenly turned and barked behind us. Nothing was in sight. I felt then that Melina had changed her mind and decided, after all, to join us. — Sarina Tomel",Sarina Tomel
29,2021-03-16T19:00:07+0000,No Words Needed,"I spoke to Sun Ung in broken Chinese, excited hand gestures and hugs. We lived together for 18 years: a strong-willed Cambodian refugee and me, his spunky Texan granddaughter. Then his Alzheimer’s took hold. He would scrunch his eyebrows, searching for our history in a sea of fading memories. I started every sentence with, “Remember when — ?” But, one of our final nights together before he died last March, we sat beside each other in silence. A granddaughter without the words to convey her love. A grandfather who didn’t need to remember the past to know she loved him anyway. — Sabrina Wong",Sabrina Wong
30,2021-03-16T19:00:07+0000,An Unexpected Request,"Chantal and I met in Bordeaux, France. I was an American student, with long hair and a beard, dressed like John Lennon in olive Army surplus fatigues. Chantal, whose grandfather escaped Mussolini, looked like Isabella Rossellini. We married in Oakland, Calif. Chantal did not want children; I did. We divorced. Chantal’s journey continued, wild as ever. Mine: law school, suburbs, remarriage, children and Little League. Chantal would sometimes call. She became a psychologist. Once, Chantal said she wanted a child and asked if I’d be the father. I mistakenly told my wife. Flattered, remembering, hesitating, I said no. Nice though. — Mark Rice",Mark Rice
31,2021-03-09T20:30:07+0000,Turning Bitter Fruit Sweet,"A blue dawn as I think about how life will proceed without 80-year-old me. How to make those dim vapors disperse? Eggs, coffee, a thin slice of toast and — dare I open a jar of my homemade marmalade? With the inordinate work to make the jam — slicing countless sour oranges into small pieces — I’ve always saved these jars to give to special people. But today, in a wild, life-affirming gesture, I open the preserves for myself. Sticky and runny, the marmalade acts as an elixir, melting away the trailing wisps of blue. — Marilyn Slutzky Zucker",Marilyn Slutzky Zucker
32,2021-03-09T20:30:07+0000,Music From Myanmar,"I was teaching English in Myanmar when we met, two years ago. Music connected us — afternoons strumming a cheap guitar as we tried to harmonize. I was learning Burmese. He covered our apartment in Post-it notes with each item’s Burmese name. This January, I returned home to Australia because my mother was sick. In February, when the military staged a coup in Myanmar, he said, “They stole our future.” I could feel his frustration and pain. But every night when we FaceTime, he smiles and joins his neighbors as they bang kitchenware in protest. A hopeful harmony. — Audric Co",Audric Co
33,2021-03-09T20:30:07+0000,Crazy Drives,"For three days, Chris commuted six hours round trip from Virginia to his work in Pennsylvania so he could hold me as I mourned my father. Over the years, my father had done crazy drives for me, his steadfast help showing an unconditional love. Moving me from Virginia to Chicago, we talked so much we missed our exits. I thought the only people who would continue to love me that deeply were my mother and brother. But Chris did, and does. My father would be happy to know someone is still doing crazy drives for me. — Apurva Sisodia",Apurva Sisodia
34,2021-03-09T20:30:07+0000,A Stranger on the Subway,"The subway roared into 14th Street. His hand was tucked in my pocket; mine held yellow tulips. It was a brisk March evening, but the tulips were sunny, his hand warm, and I felt like spring. Wrapped in the comfort of a full belly and heart, squished into subway seats, I talked to him about things I can’t remember now. “I had to take a picture,” a woman across the train said, waving her phone. “The way you’re looking at each other — I have chills.” I miss that woman, the people she photographed and the steadiness of those springtime flowers. — Kaitlyn Powers",Kaitlyn Powers
35,2021-03-02T20:00:07+0000,The Last Word,"My first message to you, 44 years after high school: “I remember you; you had that long, pretty hair.” You told me about the car accident that left your lower body paralyzed. I told you that our wholeness doesn’t depend on the body. You wrote to me about making art, cooking, living in Mexico, your love for your son, your joyful creativity after surgery. In December, you stopped messaging. I was heartbroken to learn that you died. Then I reread your last message, about how we are connected in unseen and mystical ways. What a gift, intimacy with you. — Alice Hogan",Alice Hogan
36,2021-03-02T20:00:07+0000,Our Big Reality Check,"After my 13-year marriage fell apart, I rented an apartment a few blocks from our family home in Rome. Three days later, Italy went into lockdown. I began a new life, along with the rest of the nation, working remotely and spending time with my children. My split was suddenly the second most important thing happening. As my wife and I grappled with the pandemic, pain and regret fell to the side. Is it possible that lockdown is our friend? It may seem cruel, but we are not ready for real life. — Federico Petrangeli",Federico Petrangeli
37,2021-03-02T20:00:07+0000,‘Gram Loves You. Please Call.’,"My grandmother Ruth was like a secret agent. Before cellphones or the internet, she would covertly track her grandchildren. At 23, I moved to Mexico to work for a resort. I was, at last, on my own. One night, while I was drinking with my co-workers at a beach bar, a man from a nearby village walked in and shouted my full name. When I responded, he marched up to me and said, “Your abuela has called each house in our village. I was chosen to find you with this message: ‘Gram loves you. Please call.’” — Amy Gotliffe",Amy Gotliffe
38,2021-03-02T20:00:07+0000,Green Ginger Wine,"“It’s time, it’s time, for green ginger wine,” we would chant every Friday night as we danced around the kitchen, my lover’s hand at my waist, my arm around his wife. We drank wine from goblets as their toddler yelled happily at our feet. It would be a long time before I admitted to myself that sex with him no longer felt right, that I was more in love with our life together than I was with my lover. When I broke up with him, I stayed friends with his wife, and wondered if their child would remember me. — Melanie Pryor",Melanie Pryor
39,2021-02-23T20:00:07+0000,Negotiating Separation,"Outside the Chicago airport the cold creeps up my coat, stiffening my spine as I hug my husband. We haven’t been apart for over a year. I board the plane alone because Nick isn’t vaccinated. At immigration in Harare, I remove my wedding ring and check the “single” box. Love between two men is illegal in Zimbabwe. I adapt to survive. When I emerge, the balmy air relaxes my spine as I hug my mother, Bharati. We cry, mourning the togetherness we’ve lost this year. I also cry for my husband, who drove home alone. One reunion requiring another separation. — Khameer Kidia",Khameer Kidia
40,2021-02-23T20:00:07+0000,Weekly Apartment Party,"During World War II, Lucy was sent out of Germany by her family. Theo was imprisoned in a concentration camp until the end of the war. In 1959, they lived a floor below us in our Bronx apartment building. They had a piano but no children. My parents had three girls but no piano. When Lucy and Theo found out that the nuns at our Catholic school offered cheap piano lessons, they insisted that we practice in their apartment. Theo would sometimes play show tunes while we danced and sang along. Such a joyful cacophony we created! I hear our music still. — Rosemary Colangelo Stewart",Rosemary Colangelo Stewart
41,2021-02-23T20:00:07+0000,My ‘Feline Social Worker’,"Marjorie, my wife of 41 years, a member of our community fire department in Santa Fe, had a severe bleeding stroke. Leaving the hospital, I drove home through a raging snowstorm, fearing that I might get in an accident and be unable to help her. At home, I cried in our bed. Our cat, Bunnie, came in. Waking in the morning, I discovered that Bunnie had gathered six of her toys from around the house and placed them by my bed. After Marjorie died, my “feline social worker” looked after me until she was 20. — Bob Mizerak",Bob Mizerak
42,2021-02-23T20:00:07+0000,Not So Naturally Gifted,"My childhood memories of the Chinese New Year include the noise of my grandmother’s mahjong tiles click-clacking together. When my grandmother, Yuan, moved away from our hometown in Inner Mongolia to join my parents in the big city of Shanghai, she lost contact with her mahjong friends. My parents aren’t enthusiastic about the game, so my cousin and I offered to learn and play with our grandmother. We were naturally gifted, winning round after round. Or so I thought, until I better understood the game: My grandmother had all the tiles, but she was letting us win. — Ke Ran Huang",Ke Ran Huang
43,2021-02-16T20:00:06+0000,Lending a Dream,"I woke to Nkozi’s arm around my waist. “I had another money dream,” she said, her brow furrowing. We were barely scraping by that year. Nkozi had a lot of money dreams. “Wanna borrow my dream?” I asked. She answered in a formless hum. I pressed my lips to her temple and told her about quahogging on the beach where I grew up: digging in the sand for the quahogs, scrubbing their shells until they looked like bone, enjoying fritters and chowder. I whispered until her brow was smooth and her head was heavy in the crook of my arm. — Serena Libardi",Serena Libardi
44,2021-02-16T20:00:06+0000,What Would I Miss?,"After witnessing my parents’ divorce, I swore my life would be different. When I got divorced in my late 30s, I saw a psychologist to deal with the guilt of leaving my workaholic attorney husband and potentially hurting our children. “What will you miss if you leave him?” she said. “Sitting at a dinner table, having meals together,” I said. “But, how can you miss what you’ve never had?” I felt a gut punch; we’d rarely shared family meals. “Is that what you missed as a child?” “Yes,” I replied, finally letting myself mourn my past and present. — Kerrie Houston Reightley",Kerrie Houston Reightley
45,2021-02-16T20:00:06+0000,‘Laughter Still Lights Our Way’,"Sometimes the mind slips into dark places. On one such day, I was in the kitchen when my mind busied itself thinking about all I hadn’t achieved. Juggling a career and motherhood, I wished I had more time for both. Believing myself to be alone, I muttered, “What am I good at?” Behind me, quite unexpectedly and matter-of-factly, without a moment’s hesitation, my 6-year-old piped up in his precocious way. “But Mom, without you there would be no laughter.” Nate is almost 33 now, living on the opposite coast. Thankfully, laughter still lights our way on dark days. — Nancy Rae",Nancy Rae
46,2021-02-16T20:00:06+0000,Chicken Liver Hearts,"In the early 1970s, as a college freshman in Iowa, I met a guy who was only interested in me as a friend. We played pinball (he liked the way I leaned into the flippers) and watched movies. David wasn’t much of a cook (he used a shoe box as a dish drainer) so I was surprised when he invited me for dinner on Valentine’s Day, presenting me with grilled chicken livers (my unconventional favorite) cut into the shape of hearts. Our own hearts are now filled with scars, stents and pacemakers, but also 48 years of love. — Bonnie Miller Rubin",Bonnie Miller Rubin
47,2021-02-09T20:00:07+0000,Glad He Asked,"On our fourth date, Tayo and I ate tacos on the steps of a colorful church in Oakland, Calif. A white-haired man shuffling down the street shouted at us with slurred speech and apparent admiration: “Look at you two! Are you in love?” Tayo smiled and said, “Sure.” The old man, either unsatisfied or unable to hear, belted out again, “What’s that? Are you two in love?” Tayo and I looked at each other and laughed. We shouted a resounding “Yes!” The old man seemed appeased, and we felt the first glimmer of our answer’s truth. — Theda Maritzer",Theda Maritzer
48,2021-02-09T20:00:07+0000,Welcome to ‘Our Weird Little World’,"When my oldest friend got pregnant, I felt embarrassingly abandoned. Since fourth grade, Eloise and I had been cocooned in our weird little world; while excited, I worried that our friendship would soon become a faint star in the constellation of her life. I imagine that others in my position would feel similarly, yet I judged myself for not being more exuberant. Eloise’s daughter came, grew and learned to crawl. One day, on FaceTime, as I watched her wiggle through the doggy door, I realized I couldn’t be jealous. She was a little weirdo, just like us. — Cat Coyne",Cat Coyne
49,2021-02-09T20:00:07+0000,Nothing to Fix,"People call me heartless. I’m not. I lack one type of human connection, not all of them. I may never have a girlfriend or boyfriend, but I can love family, friends and pets. People say they can “fix” me; they can’t. I’m not broken, just different. People say it’s made up. It isn’t. I’m not heartless. I’m not broken, not a liar and not loveless. I’m just me, and I’m asexual. — Noa Callie",Noa Callie
50,2021-02-09T20:00:07+0000,Now I Know Why,"After Hazel and I got married at the ages of 20 and 21, I questioned our judgment in choosing to marry so young. When we had a baby soon after, I wondered how I could possibly support a family. In our mid-40s, I thought we were too young to become grandparents, though our grandchildren are lovely. Then when Hazel passed away at 50 from the coronavirus, I finally realized why we got married so young: We weren’t meant to grow old together. And I am grateful for our time. — Sean Luke Dado",Sean Luke Dado
51,2021-02-02T20:00:18+0000,Survival in Rural Oregon,"I found myself in rural Oregon, two years into a marriage with the wrong man and on a steep learning curve. My home: a drafty hand-built cabin with an inefficient wood stove. My partner: a developing opioid addict. Life was dark and cold. Then I met my neighbors. Some my age, some 50 years older. They shared wine, stories and laughter. They taught me to identify native plants, dress a turkey, read the lay of the land, preserve a garden harvest. And to mend everything worth saving and loving — which, their kindness taught me, included myself. — Cate Keller",Cate Keller
52,2021-02-02T20:00:18+0000,“No One’s Idea of Maternal”,"Amy was a spunky 8-year-old. She lived with our friends, but they were too old to care for her, so she would soon move to another foster home. I was no one’s idea of maternal and had never thought of raising children. But Amy wanted a family. I told my wife, “I want to adopt Amy.” We filled out paperwork, readied a bedroom and waited. After a judge’s OK, we loaded Amy’s clothes, crayons and copies of Harry Potter into our SUV. It’s been 17 years. I’m still no one’s idea of maternal, but I’m lucky to be Amy’s mother. — Lynn Domina",Lynn Domina
53,2021-02-02T20:00:18+0000,"Dude, I Bet You …","The first notable thing was that his Chinese name, Du Dao Na, sounded like, “Dude, where are you going?” The second: He had the nicest toes. We’d met as graduate-level exchange students in Taiwan. Don was wearing sandals. At Christmas, he surprised me with a kiss. I hesitated. He said, “It’s OK — I’m not dating until I find the one I’ll marry.” I asked, “How do you know that’s not me?” He replied, “I worry you’d tire of me.” I said, “Oh yeah? I bet I won’t!” Twenty-five years, three countries and two children later, I’m still winning that bet. — Doris Chou-Durfee",Doris Chou-Durfee
54,2021-02-02T20:00:18+0000,One Last Lovely Dinner,"My father lay dying of the coronavirus. A normally ebullient 96-year-old, he drifted in and out of consciousness as I, also infected, sat at his bedside. His lucid moments were precious opportunities for connection and FaceTime calls with his grandchildren. One afternoon, he commanded me to get his yellow collared shirt, blue blazer, khaki pants, Sperry shoes and one of his many bow ties. I laid everything on his bed as he talked about going out to a lovely dinner with my mother, who had died 17 years earlier. Then my father closed his eyes. — Katharine Cunningham",Katharine Cunningham
55,2021-01-26T20:08:13+0000,Taking the Wheel,"My grandparents had a 20-foot-long, “Breaking Bad”-style camper that they would drive from snowy Wisconsin to sunny Florida. When I told my grandfather about my pipe dream to take the van on a graduation road trip, he smiled and said, “I’ll drive.” By the time I graduated college, both the camper and my grandpa were gone. Instead, I drove all over the East Coast in his ’99 Toyota — his sunglasses and spare change still in the cup holders. As I started my journey, I gripped the weathered steering wheel and smiled. It felt like he and I were driving. — Angie Newman",Angie Newman
56,2021-01-26T20:08:13+0000,United by Flight,"We took a course at Barnard about the birds of New York. Before a quiz, I made a GarageBand track with bird names and Audubon recordings. “Blue jay.” “Tufted titmouse.” I wrote, then rewrote, an email to Lhana: “In case this helps you study for the quiz!” She didn’t respond. But after we took the quiz on a windy day in Jamaica Bay, she sat next to me on the bus to Manhattan and said thanks. Years later, I proposed to her while playing the bird songs over speakers in an empty theater. When she said yes, my heart soared. — Madeline Taylor",Madeline Taylor
57,2021-01-26T20:08:13+0000,He Lives in My Phone,"I last saw Ajay on our two-year anniversary; it will be our third before I see him next. During the pandemic, I have forgotten what it’s like to be with him in real life. Some nights, I ask him to stay with me until morning. I place my phone next to my pillow as if he’s there next to me and listen to him shuffle against the blankets. Then, I close my eyes and fill in the blanks: his arms looped around me, my legs braided gently into his. It reminds my body of the warmth it has forgotten. — Katherine Hu",Katherine Hu
58,2021-01-26T20:08:13+0000,Shelter Dog for a Sheltered Heart,"They deemed her unadoptable because she was scared of everything. But lying on the cold shelter floor that January day, she cracked open my guarded heart. A week later, I brought home my shaggy little bear and called her Stevie. She’s still scared of many things: the garbage truck, men in uniform, loud children. But she has developed a fondness for just as many others: barbecue chicken, snuggles on the couch, walks in the park. If you want to learn how to be loved, adopt a dog who needs to learn how, too. — Lee Propp",Lee Propp
59,2021-01-19T20:00:07+0000,Renewal Near the Aegean Sea,"Mario was a foster child; I was a sheltered bookworm. We married young in Union, Maine. When the seven-year itch hit, we decided to renovate a cliff-side villa in Santorini for a crazy Malibu defense attorney. It was 1994, before the island’s spine sprouted resorts. Work days included transporting bags of cement on donkeys’ backs. Days off we hiked, swam, tanned on topless beaches. We toasted our relationship every pink Homeric sunset. At night, we ate fava beans and fish washed down with retsina. And olives. Oh, those olives. — Sherry Barker Abaldo",Sherry Barker Abaldo
60,2021-01-19T20:00:07+0000,A House Divided,"Years ago, I was in Wisconsin visiting Mom. One night, slightly intoxicated, my brother laid into her and me with hatred of the president she and I supported. Stunned, we left. Politics have divided our houses since. Mom called one recent night: My brother has coronavirus. Shaken, I debated reaching out. Would he want to hear from me? Next morning, I heard about a congressman whose son had died by suicide and the support he received from Democrats and Republicans during the insurrection in Washington. I texted my brother and his wife with inquiries, well wishes. Only his wife replied. — Wendy Lukomski",Wendy Lukomski
61,2021-01-19T20:00:07+0000,Were We ‘Meant to Be’?,"I saw Anthony now and then in Los Angeles bars. We were always friendly. Then, one Friday we bumped into each other at a street fair. We ran into each other again on Saturday. Sunday, too. Still, only flirty chat and ambivalence. On Monday, while I was driving, Anthony walked right past me. I finally gave him my number and cooked him dinner a week later. Still married 17 years later, we don’t believe in “meant to be.” We believe in a mixture of heart and head: luck and commitment. — Dean Decent",Dean Decent
62,2021-01-19T20:00:07+0000,A True Milestone,"The day before my 32nd birthday, Greg gripped my hand in the emergency room. The sonogram revealed a miscarriage. He comforted and anchored me as I waded in a sea of grief for weeks, then months. Seven years and two children later, Greg remembered to pick up my 39th birthday cake, along with hand sanitizer, as New York City lurched toward a grim shutdown. Now, almost a year later, almost a year older, almost a year at home, I walk bravely toward my 40th birthday, knowing the true milestone is our love and health. — Christine Byun",Christine Byun
63,2021-01-12T20:00:08+0000,A Game of Silence,"She took my picture at New York’s Village Halloween Parade. I walked to our first date feeling intimidated by her beauty and photography credentials. I texted, “How about we don’t speak tonight?” She replied, “Sounds fun! For how long?” “Until it hurts.” We went to Eataly. Strangers helped us order, thinking we were deaf. After a kiss and a jazz club, I finally spoke: “Where are we going?” She pointed at me. We went to my apartment and lived happily together for the next eight months, until she moved to Europe for work. Now there’s too much silence. — Steve Wruble",Steve Wruble
64,2021-01-12T20:00:08+0000,Almost Twins,"Chenoa was born six days before I turned 2. Growing up, we had joint birthday parties and were mistaken for twins. I fought for individuality, resisting when our mother tried to dress us alike. Chenoa cried when I escaped our shared bottom bunk for my own bed, or hid from her in the Delaware woods near our home to read in precious solitude. She followed me to college, then D.C. We lived together as sister-soulmate-besties until romance pulled her to Philadelphia. Now I cherish our rare, precious visits, whispering and giggling in my bed like neither of us ever left. — Candace Valencia Freeman",Candace Valencia Freeman
65,2021-01-12T20:00:08+0000,Always,"Standing near her locker in a Bronx high school, my 16-year-old mother was stood up by a boy who, she later learned, was with another girl on the field bleachers. My father swept in, offering to walk her home and carry her books. For the next 71 years, they would carry one another until they both became Covid-19 casualties, dying 10 hours and one mile apart in different hospitals. Their funeral was a blend of six feet under meets six feet apart. The only solace was that they would rest together — always, as their favorite Frank Sinatra song declared. — Marcy Tolkoff Levy",Marcy Tolkoff Levy
66,2021-01-12T20:00:08+0000,‘Love Them More’,"In our mid-30s, Angie and I got together, both of us wanting a baby. On a date at my nephew’s high school musical, one child sang loudly off tune, danced in the wrong direction and dropped lines. As others covered for him, I leaned over and whispered, “What would you do if that was your kid?” Angie looked at him, then me, and replied, “I’d just love him so much.” Now that we have two 13-year-olds, her words echo a deep truth about parenting: You’ll love your children no matter what, but when it’s tough, love them more. — Elizabeth Stark",Elizabeth Stark
67,2021-01-05T20:00:07+0000,A Warm Cup in Our Camper,"He brings me coffee in bed every morning. It’s far from the dreamy depiction of romantic comedies — not in an apartment with a city view or a house tucked in a cul-de-sac, but in the frigid cold of our tiny camper, where I sit, barely awake, swimming in a sea of blankets. We live in a camper in the Kentucky woods to keep from being homeless. For me, he wakes early to make coffee in an old-fashioned teakettle on the fire outside. I sip it, knowing how loved and lucky I am. — Amanda Jean Alley",Amanda Jean Alley

I made the season merry for my daughter, though inside I felt like the sun would never shine. Over the years, I accepted that sadness would arrive around December. I greeted it at the door with a cocktail in hand — recently, with a pot of coffee. Sad and happy memories will always sit together at my holiday table, like restless houseguests. In the new year, happiness extends its stay while sadness slips quietly out the door. — Gloria Barone Rosanio",Gloria Barone Rosanio

It was supposed to be a fling. But our first date lasted six hours. Our second lasted 12. For our fourth date, Anabelle drove down from Maine just to see me for 48 hours. Three years later, we live together in Portland where we had our fifth date. With luck, a “little something to do” might become the rest of our lives. — Elliot Walsh",Elliot Walsh
70,2021-01-05T20:00:07+0000,My 6-Year-Old Won,"When my son was small, we turned our “love you” affirmations at bedtime into a game; the winner made the other feel most loved. One night, I told him that I loved him so much, my love filled his bedroom and flowed out the windows like a tidal wave into the streets of New York City. Not to be outdone, 6-year-old Quinn said he loved me so much that his love filled every single atom in the entire universe, and there was nowhere I could go where I wouldn’t feel it and know it. He won. — Laura Plybon",Laura Plybon

Through the muffled cadence of his voice, I deduce if he’s in virtual school or playing an online game. Thrice a day, he comes up for air, asking, “What’s there to eat?” We used to talk a lot on our car rides, about life and feelings. Now we have nowhere to go. For the holidays, I make him my sous chef. Slicing a butternut squash, my knife slips. He takes my bleeding finger in his hand and blows a kiss. Food an excuse, we talk about feelings again. — Yogyata Singh Davé",Yogyata Singh Davé

On my weekend, he takes me on a trip to South Korea through Google Maps. We “stay” at the beautiful Hotel Shilla, where the daily rate costs more than my weekly food budget. We go on Street View to see the school John grew up attending and visit his favorite childhood haunts. We travel to different cities, my cursor dragging through streets and alleyways. John says, “I hope I can take you there for real one day.” — Erika Lee",Erika Lee
73,2020-12-29T20:00:07+0000,Seeing Myself Looking Back,"Max and I first locked eyes across a classroom our sophomore year of high school, each sensing someone uncannily familiar staring back. We became fast friends, and suburban mischief ensued. We taught ourselves (and each other) a new, queer brand of masculinity, reveling in the freedom that comes from an instinctive mutual understanding. Then high school ended. She left for the military. I, for university. Differences that once felt small and sparse grew vast and plentiful. Yet, as we’ve come into our own, our paths realigned. Sometimes, it still feels like that first meeting, like looking into a mirror. — Kelsey Smoot",Kelsey Smoot
74,2020-12-29T20:00:07+0000,‘It’ll Heal’,"On Jan. 3, in the emergency room with a broken femur, I realized my year had ended before it began. I had fallen 20 feet in a climbing accident in a gym in Atlanta. My hospital room was filled with my family, my partner, and fruit freshly cut by my mother. “It’ll heal,” said my surgeon. Twelve months, multiple quarantines and one healed femur later, I look 20 feet around me and still see my family, my partner and freshly cut fruit. I feel hopeful that next year will lead to further healing. — Melissa Zhu",Melissa Zhu

I’ve always adored the holidays, but growing up in Florida meant I never experienced the “White Christmas” dream. After moving to Dallas, I started dating a woman who worked on a Christmas tree lot across the street from my apartment. Marleana would come over, smelling of pine, her arms toned from all the lifting. She was my lesbian Hallmark Christmas film fantasy. She even owned a shiny red truck that we drove in to find snow. Her Christmas gift this year? An engagement ring. — Hannah Melin",Hannah Melin
76,2020-12-22T20:00:06+0000,I Finally Said It,"In Kolkata, “I love you” is not said often, and certainly not to parents. It is considered over the top; translated into Bengali, it can sound mawkish. I improvise when I call my parents in India from my apartment in New York. “I wish I had your tenacity,” I tell my mother. I praise my father’s compassion. “Wish you were here” is the furthest I venture. Yesterday, when my mother said that she longed to see me and her voice faltered, I blurted out those three words. The heart grows fonder when parents are old and away, but a pandemic makes it bolder. — Satarupa Ghosh Roy",Satarupa Ghosh Roy
77,2020-12-22T20:00:06+0000,‘I Need to Get Over Someone’,"I walked into the cramped East Village candle store. The man behind the counter asked what I needed. “I heard that you … help people,” I said. He rubbed his hands together like he was about to make his favorite meal. “I need to get over someone,” I said. He nodded and retrieved a black candle from a shelf: “I need your initials and his.” I watched as he carved my heartbreak into the wax. “Burn this for seven days. You’ll feel better.” On day seven, I met someone new. It was a brief, healing romance. I never looked back. — Felice Neals",help

They were married for 56 years before she passed away. They slept in the same bed until the end, holding hands every night as they drifted off to sleep. My father has Alzheimer’s. Some days he doesn’t know who she is; others he speaks as if she’s in the room, calling out over his shoulder, “Rose — ” as if memory is music only he can hear. — Amy Massingale",Amy Massingale

80,2020-12-15T20:42:27+0000,Playing With Dolls,"It was Los Angeles in the 1950s, and my mother was ahead of her time. After my older sister, Debbie, got a doll, I wanted one just like hers. Of course my mother said yes. My mother’s friend, June, came over. They sat at the kitchen table. I was within earshot, dressing my beloved doll, when June said, “Marian, boys shouldn’t play with dolls.” To which my mother responded, “If Danny wants to play with dolls, he can play with dolls.” My doll was dressed and ready for an outing, and my mother looked at me adoringly. — Daniel Nathanson",Daniel Nathanson
81,2020-12-15T20:42:27+0000,Unexpected Intimacy,"Running to stay strong, to fill time, to be connected to ground and air and the space between one breath in and another out. Sometimes running is meditative solitude, sometimes joyful: for me, and me alone! Sometimes the isolation is crushing. Tears start before my feet stop. An evening run, 10 months into weathering the pandemic on my own. Another runner and I fall in step. There’s no explicit acknowledgment or agreement. But for a quarter mile in Queens, we maintain our pace. Breathing heavy through masks. Moving in tandem until our paths diverge. Distant but close. — Paige Arthur",Paige Arthur
82,2020-12-15T20:42:27+0000,No Need for the Awkward Talk,"On our first anniversary, my husband gave me a beautiful piece of raku pottery. I loved that pot with its iridescent glaze so much that he gave me another piece for my birthday. And another for Hanukkah. I thought about telling him that my pottery collection was complete. The next year he surprised me with a glass vase. I considered launching into the uncomfortable “I have enough breakable containers” talk but held my tongue. Six months later, he wrapped up my vase and gave it to his relative. I didn’t know whether to be angry or relieved. I chose relieved. — Ilene Haddad",Ilene Haddad
83,2020-12-08T20:00:54+0000,What My Mother Taught Me,"My mother, Wilma, adored Lifetime movies. Sick days away from school meant sleeping in, waking to the hum of television. Sporting an oversized T-shirt and fever, I would inch into the hall, listening for those sentimental melodramas. I’d creep to the living room couch and burrow against my mother. Though I wasn’t normally allowed to watch these films, my illness acted as a skeleton key. My mother stroked my forehead, covered my eyes from the wet, on-screen kisses. I listened to her laughs and gasps, learning when to laugh and gasp myself. I was her flu-ridden impersonator, her couch-bound copycat. — Ashley Jeffalone",Ashley Jeffalone
84,2020-12-08T20:00:54+0000,Two Equestrians Walk Into an Emergency Room,"We met in an emergency department north of Paris. After separate horse-riding accidents, we found ourselves there sporting ripped, muddy jodhpurs and fractured collarbones. The wait meant we could speak at length and realize that we agreed on nothing: politics, religion, philosophy, literature, equestrian ideology. We even clashed on the level of pain a broken collarbone caused. But we shared a fervent French belief in freedom of expression. Have our differences have softened over the years? No. Against the odds, we live, love, feud and laugh in rural France, surrounded by the horses that brought us together. — Fiona McGeachie Gallot",Fiona McGeachie Gallot
85,2020-12-08T20:00:54+0000,Calling Anyway,"When my friends ask me over FaceTime how I’m doing, I tell them that I spend a lot of time crying. It’s easier than admitting that I can’t seem to get out of bed before 2 p.m. Or wash the dishes that are stinking up my sink. Or get done any work that I normally love doing. But it’s more honest than “good.” Sometimes they laugh and say “same,” and sometimes they look down and don’t know what to say. The rest of the conversation limps along. I apologize for being a stranger. They call me every week anyway. — Jemma Dooreleyers",Jemma Dooreleyers

She asked me if I knew what happened. I said no. She asked me to dinner. With time to kill before I could enter my building, I said yes. She was blonde, Christian and a Red Sox fan: a Holy Trinity of forbidden fruit for me, son of New York’s Upper West Side. (We also understood each other’s jokes too late.) We weren’t right for one another. But, after a previous breakup, she got me back out there. Bombs away.— Jay Rappaport",Jay Rappaport

At university, she studies operational meteorology; he studies English and writes poetry. It takes them only five months from first date to vows and embroidered towels. With tensions high during a Thanksgiving visit to her family with their infant son, her grandmother tells them that they are only together for the sex. Tears ensue. Bags are packed. Yet, after 17 years, two children and six jobs in Alaska and South Dakota, I have to say, dear reader, the sex is still spectacular. — Stan Wise",Stan Wise
88,2020-12-01T20:00:08+0000,Written on Skin,"My skin knew on our second date. It warned me that our connection was too quick, too intense with red, peeling patches across my cheeks and chin. (Dermatitis, dermatologists said, unsure of the trigger. Stress, maybe, or some unknown irritant. I dismissed it with prescription desoximetasone.) My skin knew the week before our wedding, swelling until my eyes shut tight, so puffy and pink and full of panic. My skin knew the moment it met my wedding band. The rash on my ring finger only left when I did, two years later. My skin always knew. Underneath, I did too. — Jessica DeFino",Jessica DeFino

What to do for my mother Louise’s 81st birthday? “I know,” he said to me. “She wants a haircut. I’ll trim her hair.” Days later, I approached their porch, met by my redheaded mother and her new ’do. Punk cut. Sideburns. Half-inch bangs pointing forward like the bill of a cap. Without exchanging a word, we start laughing — guffawing, really. My mother shushes me once we can breathe. “Mary, don’t say anything to him. Don’t hurt your daddy’s feelings.” — Mary Storms",Mary Storms

I was preparing to return home to India, where I would stay until international travel restrictions lifted. My mother called, asking what I wanted to eat when I got to Mumbai. She would plan her lockdown shopping accordingly. “Pani puri!” I answered. Later that day, I was chatting with my boyfriend’s mother while she washed dishes in her Pennsylvania kitchen.

When I pulled a cloth along the closet shelf, a shower of mint Lifesavers rained down, left behind from my father’s last visit. An ex-smoker, he always kept his mouth busy. I unwrapped one, placing it, Communion-like, on my tongue. I wasn’t able to save my father’s life; the lung cancer was a wildfire. But as the Lifesaver dissolved, it cleansed me. — Julia Bruce",Julia Bruce
92,2020-11-24T20:00:07+0000,Within His Radius,"Visiting my parents in Seattle, I expected my Tinder match with Jason to go like all the rest: warm hello, flirty banter, gradual trailing off. Back then, I traveled constantly for work, swiping everywhere, jaded but still looking despite myself. I returned home to Boston before Jason and I could meet. We communicated constantly. Discovering that neither of us had plans for Thanksgiving, we decided to meet somewhere between us (Nashville) and celebrate. We ate turkey and potatoes on our first date. One year married, Jason admits that he wasn’t looking for anyone outside of a five-mile radius. — Ian McKinley",Ian McKinley
93,2020-11-24T20:00:07+0000,She’s Back in Our Bed,"In 1998, I decided to get rid of my very 1980s-looking bachelor furniture. After posting on Craigslist, a gentleman came over with a tape measure. Everything would fit, including my king-size platform bed. He just needed run it by his girlfriend. The next day, the doorbell rang. When I opened the door, I saw the man and my ex-girlfriend from 20 years earlier. We shared our surprise, then moved on to the bedroom set. They said it was perfect. I said to my ex, “That was ours — are you sure you want it?” “Absolutely.” And off they went. — Paul Weinberg",Paul Weinberg
94,2020-11-24T20:00:07+0000,Eyes Only,"Two travel nurses, we arrived in New Mexico to help with the pandemic. We met in the hospital’s Covid-19 tent, glimmers of desert sun streaming in. Pushing through 12-and-a-half-hour shifts, we interacted as we treated patients and tested the sick. A quiet connection grew. With our faces covered, we could only see each other’s eyes. I didn’t see his hidden smile for weeks. When I did, it felt like seeing weeks of masked smiles in an instant. His face, once unknown, soon became home. His heart, a remedy for uncertainty. — Jacqueline McMahon",Jacqueline McMahon
95,2020-11-17T20:00:07+0000,Magic in Manila,"At 5, I believed that my father could perform magic. In Manila’s moist heat, he drove in stop-and-go traffic with five screaming children and a broken AC. If we were very quiet, he said, he would use his powers to make the billboard flip screens. We quieted and he chanted an incantation, waved his hand, then flicked his fingers in perfect sync with the billboard change. Goosebumps peppered my arms. No one talked until I begged him to do it again. He died when I was 10. To this day, magic is intertwined with my memories of him.— Rowena Leong Singer",Rowena Leong Singer
96,2020-11-17T20:00:07+0000,My Gentle Sun,"Carlos rubs my feet and kisses my toes when we lie under the sun near the Hudson River. I like to watch him. It soothes me to know someone so gentle moves through this world and has chosen to move through it with me. When he laughs his eyes crinkle, and he covers his mouth because he thinks his teeth are a mess. I think his teeth are beautiful. When it’s cloudy, he tells me not to worry, his dance will wish away the rain. What he doesn’t know is that it matters little — Carlos is the sun. — Madhuri Pavamani",Madhuri Pavamani
97,2020-11-17T20:00:07+0000,Sending Love,"From a refugee camp in Uganda, my mother, Safiya, calls to ask how I am doing in Canada. She has been listening to the BBC and heard that the cost of living is climbing in North America. “Please do not send me money until things get better for you,” she says. I am overcome with emotion, realizing that my aging mother, who fled civil war in Somalia, is more worried about me despite her vulnerabilities. As I navigate the pandemic, I am comforted by her love, which means so much more than the monthly 150 dollars I send her. — Muno Osman",Muno Osman
98,2020-11-17T20:00:07+0000,"Whiteouts and Ice, Then Help","The polar vortex of 2019 arrived in Montana, bringing snow, snow, snow and paralyzing cold. A single mother and cattle rancher, I drove my boys 50 miles to school, returned to feed my 200 cattle midday, then retrieved the boys through blinding whiteouts and ice, ice, ice. No help available, I pushed through alone. My truck tire chains disappeared in snow, frigid cattle cried, the neighbor’s newborn calves unable to survive. On Saturday, my 18-year-old son, Riley, saw my exhaustion. “I’ll help you plow.” Four hours later at -10 degrees, he stepped off the tractor. The road was open.— Jenny Kahrl",Jenny Kahrl
99,2020-11-10T20:00:08+0000,Just Me and My Sea Monkeys,"I was in love and in lockdown in a small flat in Leith, Scotland. I had a lot of feelings and nowhere to put them. So I bought sea monkeys. I poured in the powder and checked the water temperature. For weeks, nothing. My last-ditch effort at finding something small (and within the rental agreement) to nurture was pointless. But then, so small you could barely make them out, a glimmer of hope and companionship in two tiny wriggling specks. — Claire Aubin",Claire Aubin
100,2020-11-10T20:00:08+0000,Without Him,"After dinner this March, my 28-year-old son decided to leave this world. He left me his cat. I didn’t want his cat; I wanted him. His cat didn’t want me; she wanted him. She cries all night. I cry all day. She sneaks into his bedroom to look for him; so do I. She smells his sheets; so do I. She waits by the front door; so do I. We’ve learned to find comfort in each other. We snuggle, sleep and mourn together. I had a beautiful boy named Elias. Now I have a beautiful cat named Damie. — Deirdre Stein",Deirdre Stein
101,2020-11-10T20:00:08+0000,Missed Connection,"I’ve received the same email twice within the past six months, a notification from LinkedIn that the man I had an affair with more than a decade ago viewed my profile. He was never good with the internet, so I doubt he realizes I can see this. Maybe it was his partner, on his account, communicating a deliberate: “I see you.” I don’t know, but I’m ashamed to admit that the messages made me feel much like he did years ago. It’s still nice to be noticed. — Karen Moore",Karen Moore
102,2020-11-10T20:00:08+0000,"Righty and Lefty, Together Again","They were the perfect pair — strikingly red, lustrous and cashmere-lined. I fell in love with my gloves, Lefty and Righty. However, like many ideal couples, they met an untimely separation one wintry day. I searched everywhere for Righty, mourning its loss. The remainder of the winter, as punishment, I wore a pair of cheap black gloves, ill-fitting and pilly. Fate intervened in the spring. Peeping under a mound of melting icy snow, faded, frozen and shriveled, was Righty! A chance encounter, saddle soap and love brought Lefty and Righty together, still the perfect pair. — Nancy M. Newman",Nancy M. Newman
103,2020-11-03T20:00:08+0000,"Broken Glasses, Clear Vision","In 1966, I saw Ken at New Haven’s only gay bar on Halloween. We ate hamburgers and then went back to his room at Yale, where we made out in front of his fireplace. I stepped on his glasses, then tried to hide that I had broken them by pushing them under a chair. I remember snuggling into him (he is a head taller than me) and feeling safe for the first time in my life. This Halloween marks 54 years together. I say it was love at first sight, even though Ken had trouble seeing me. — Ronald Kirchem",Ronald Kirchem
104,2020-11-03T20:00:08+0000,Fleeing the Flames,"“Got your passports? Underwear? Flashlight radios?” My family of five split into two cars, figuring a car saved was a car gained. Mid-dinner, “Evacuation Order” pinged on our phones. The inferno scorched the foothills, threatening our San Jose, Calif., home. We sped to a beachside inn, the waves our protector. Amid the hazy Pacific air, Dad — bereft of utensils — whomped a watermelon open. My sister, Arianna, humored spotty video classes. My mom and my brother, Aidan, dug a sand tunnel. Whether our house would survive was anyone’s guess, but in this salty seaside suite, we found hearth and home. — Melody Cao",Melody Cao
105,2020-11-03T20:00:08+0000,The Smalls Loving Big,"We call ourselves the Smalls. Both under 5-foot-7, my boyfriend and I laugh about how different life must be with a few extra inches. On March 23, panic was mounting in New York City. When my mother called, we had barely figured out how to coexist in my studio apartment. My uncle — 68 years old and healthy — had died of coronavirus. Four hundred square feet isn’t much space to grieve, but the walls never closed in. Seven months later, space remains limited and our size is unchanged. The loss is immeasurable, but so is the love. — Sophie Jacob",Sophie Jacob
106,2020-11-03T20:00:08+0000,You Can Stay by Me,"Mrs. Abby played guitar. She was young and beautiful, and I loved her so. She let me stay in at recess even though that was her break time. I don’t remember much about third grade in 1970, but I knew my teacher loved me when it felt like no one else did, and that was enough to get me through a day. I’ve been teaching for 25 years now. Sometimes there are students who need to know their teacher loves them when no one else does. Sometimes they stay in at recess. Sometimes I play the guitar. — Hope Watterson",Hope Watterson
107,2020-10-27T19:00:07+0000,Embracing a New Life and Love,"When I lifted the baby girl to my chest, it was love, overwhelming and instant. Then came the Spider-Man light-up shoes. The short haircut. The six-pack of superhero undies from the boys section. The tantrums over having to wear a top at the pool. The revelation that a different life was possible. The trying of new names. The telling of family, friends, school. And now our love is different, new. The love of mother and her 8-year-old son. The loving of someone for who they truly are, not whom you had imagined them to be. — Kate Streip",Kate Streip
108,2020-10-27T19:00:07+0000,Tired of Looking at Myself,"During my first shelter-in-place “date,” I saw myself watching him looking at me on the video call. Despite my best efforts, I was consumed by my mannerisms. Do I always tilt my head like that? Does this look like a neutral smile and not a grimace? The experience was alienating and unsettling. It increased my anxiety and crippled our conversation. Still, we decided to meet for an in-person picnic, where I could only see his face, not mine. We’ve been dating since. — Kate Sautter",Kate Sautter
109,2020-10-27T19:00:07+0000,Defining the Relationship,"I met Ashley while moving a sofa out of a walk-up in Minneapolis. Six months later, we went to a political fund-raiser. The organizer asked us how we knew each other. I said we were friends. She said, “We’re dating.” Later, I said, “Are we dating?” We had been spending all of our free time together, but I didn’t know. Ashley said, “Yes, you’re my girlfriend and I’m your girlfriend. I was in love with you the moment I met you.” We’re celebrating our anniversary this month. However, if you ask Ashley, she would say our celebration is long overdue. — Clare Baumgart",Clare Baumgart
110,2020-10-27T19:00:07+0000,An Open Purse on the Park Bench,"My grandmother’s purse sat open and unattended on a park bench in the 1950s Bronx. Alarmed, my young mother said, “Mom, your purse is open!” “It’s OK, honey,” my grandmother said. “If someone takes it, they need it more than I do.” In that moment, my mother’s young world took on a new hue. They were a poor Jewish family of five living in a small two-bedroom apartment. They barely got by. Yet, my grandmother left her heart and purse open to those who needed it most. — Deborah L. Staunton",Deborah L. Staunton
111,2020-10-20T19:00:07+0000,With a Touch of Love,"My father, Seung-ho, has always had an eye for little details. About two months into sheltering-in-place, I asked him to grab me chocolate almond milk at the grocery store. When he came home with cashew milk, I started to complain that he got the wrong milk. He interrupted me, pointing to the bottom of the carton. There, in small text, it stated, “with a touch of almond.” My annoyance melted into a wide grin because I knew how hard he must have looked to find the most almond-like milk available for me. — Rachael Lee",Rachael Lee
112,2020-10-20T19:00:07+0000,Three Stops on the Uptown Train,"Fifty-ninth Street subway platform. 6 p.m. The uptown train arrives. One car stops in front of me, another in front of him. Our stares are interrupted as we board the crowded train. He races closer to me, bumping into a mother holding a baby. He comforts the baby from crying, then keeps staring at me until my 77th Street stop. I get off. He holds his foot in the door to see if I’ll turn around. When I do, he jumps off. Forty-two years later, and married, we still look at each other with the same intensity. — Mark Wolk",Mark Wolk
113,2020-10-20T19:00:07+0000,Learning to Live,"When I was little, I would rush into my parents’ room at night to ensure they were breathing. As I grew older, I became increasingly preoccupied by death: Why do we do anything if the end is inevitable? Filled with existential dread, I’d burrow in bed for weeks. Eventually, my depressive fears found respite in knowledge. While completing my music therapy degree with an internship in hospice care, I met Seth, a registered nurse. After helping people die all day, we couldn’t help but climb in bed and be alive, honoring what feels right, right now. — Sarah Ward",Sarah Ward
114,2020-10-20T19:00:07+0000,Too Much Reality? Try Fiction,"At 90, my mother found fiction, something she had scorned her entire life. A news-loving, quick-witted, born-and-bred New Yorker, she breathlessly followed current events. Who needs a newsfeed with her calling me at work to announce that Tim Russert died? After two cornea transplants at 88, my mother shifted her perspective on fiction — and life. With her new sight, she views the world through a more sentimental lens. Now open to the imaginary, she devours novels, which we discuss like schoolgirls, reveling in our shared refuge from reality. — Melissa Zeph",Melissa Zeph
115,2020-10-13T19:00:18+0000,My Life as a Kernel,"The way a never-been-kissed 23-year-old feels on a date’s couch is the same way the last unpopped popcorn kernel feels in the microwave. As an anxious and over-scheduled kernel, I always stopped the timer before the ideal mark. But on a walk with a coronavirus-free individual, I gained the courage to complete the cycle of electromagnetic waves. These past months of death and injustice have taught me that life is short. I never knew what would diminish my first-kiss fear. Turns out a pandemic is a really good microwave. — Kate Kesselman",Kate Kesselman
116,2020-10-13T19:00:18+0000,We Came From Her Leg,"I sit in my mother’s bed in Michigan. She asks, “How did I make you?” Her eyes are fresh flowers. Her thin arms are stems. “I came from your leg,” I answer. She has a long scar above her knee from an old accident. When we were young, she convinced my three sisters and me that this was how we were born. I run to the fridge before we continue our game. Nothing is there but a box, her hospice package. Morphine and pills. She has dementia and doesn’t know she’s dying. I do. Brave for love, I walk back in. — Nancy Shayne",Nancy Shayne
117,2020-10-13T19:00:18+0000,A Railway Farewell,"She saw me in college, found me online and told me I was cute. On our first date at a New Delhi cafe, her anxiety made her talk nonstop. We discussed how the world had so many children that we would never want to procreate. When I left the city to look for a better career, she insisted on dropping me at the railway station. It became our ritual whenever I visited. Those farewells were painful. But I never realized how grateful I was for her seeing me off until our final goodbye, when I was standing on the platform alone. — Manik Saggar",Manik Saggar
118,2020-10-13T19:00:18+0000,The Last Loop,"Anna was at the age when pebbles or crayons could symbolize our five family members. Sitting on my lap, she played with my necklace, a pendant of nesting rings. Her little fingers separated each silver loop. “This circle is Daddy,” she said. “This one is Ali, this one is Michael, this one is me.” She left me out. I felt an irrational, childish wisp of disappointment. Was my mothering meaningless, my love invisible? She paused, then touched the tiny circle that joined the others to the chain. “And this one is you, Mommy, because you hold us all together.” — Leah DeCesare",Leah DeCesare
119,2020-10-06T19:00:09+0000,A Love Nest in Connecticut,"Four years ago, a pair of sparrows built a nest in our microwave vent. My husband evicted them. They rebuilt. My husband gave up. The squawking squatters now return every May to raise a family. We hear their peeping while eating our oatmeal and watch the couple fly around our yard, looking for food for their brood. In October, we know by the sudden quiet that they and their children have left. We take solace in their ability to rebuild each year, happy to provide them with a love nest in a Connecticut vent. — Beth Levine",Beth Levine

I apologize for this mortifying virus, for causing her such deep grief and for needing to be waited on day and night. “Don’t,” she says, tongue thick with hurt. “I love you.” Her response takes away my already-short breath as I suddenly understand my myopia: 52 years of marriage and I still think love must be earned. Outside my window, live oaks and Spanish moss sway. I look in her pooling eyes. Through this dark devastation, old love blossoms anew. — Steven Lewis",Steven Lewis
121,2020-10-06T19:00:09+0000,Held by String,"At 11, I was the youngest in the eating disorder program. In her 60s, Shelly was the oldest. Trapped in armchairs that smelled like scrambled eggs, we fiddled with everything: threads, tissues, clothing, beads. When a counselor confiscated my playthings, Shelly intervened: “She’s just a baby.” After 100 days, I was released. Shelly pressed a bracelet into my palm — tiny, opalescent beads strung between two leather cords. Seven years later, my wrist is too big for Shelly’s bracelet. But looking at the beads nestled in the tough leather, I think of the young girl in the veteran’s arms. — Eliza Rudalevige",Eliza Rudalevige

This is how he transported it two miles west across Manhattan to its new home. I swooned at his ingenuity, jogging behind him with a yellow Gatorade. We wove through traffic on First Avenue and past the busy fruit sellers. Old men in Central Park paused their chess game to applaud. Bikers cheered as we took the mattress down the pedestrian lane. After our hourlong odyssey, we kissed through our masks. This city that some are calling dead is very much alive. — Meghan Gunn",Meghan Gunn
123,2020-09-29T19:00:07+0000,Sending Love,"Getting care packages at sleep-away camp felt like getting hugs through the mail. Gum, games and Mad Libs equaled instant, albeit fleeting, popularity. Now, from upstate New York, I return the favor to my mother at her senior residence in San Francisco. Dried apricots, bagels and lox, and masks show my love, but they cannot replace real contact, nor clear California’s smoky air. Midway through summer camp, we’d watch each parent’s car pull up to find their camper. Hugs during those reunions were big and long. Please, are we midway through this ordeal yet? — Melissa McNeese",Melissa McNeese
124,2020-09-29T19:00:07+0000,Still Holding Me Tight,"Conor and I had just decided to go steady when his Canadian visa expired. He wanted me to return to Ireland with him. I didn’t want him to be my only lifeline in an unfamiliar country. “Let’s go be starving artists in Berlin instead,” I said, half joking. Berlin was new to both of us. After moving, we didn’t have much. We shared a small bed and a single pillow, but I was happy because he held me tight as we slept every night. Years later, on our queen bed with an excess of pillows, he still holds me like I would fall off if he didn’t. — Sandy Yu",Sandy Yu
125,2020-09-29T19:00:07+0000,A Man of Many Tongues and Titles,"All night, my grandfather, Pepere, speaks in languages my family does not understand, claiming that dozens of robbers are breaking in or a concert is out on the deck. On unlucky dementia days, he confuses me for a past girlfriend, or puts the remote in the microwave. Pepere has earned many titles: World War II soldier, labor camp survivor, refugee to France and, most recently, 100-year-old grandfather. These days, my family focuses on the present, grateful for the warmth of his smile, the life of his language and the autumn of his age. — Abby Donnelly",Abby Donnelly
126,2020-09-29T19:00:07+0000,It’s OK to Feel This Way,"He got sad first. In a sea of anxiety, he lost his sense of self and self-worth. Sometimes, I cradled him in my arms and covered his face with kisses. Sometimes, I retreated into the calm of my own inner world. I got sad second. One morning, after arguing with my mother over coronavirus conspiracy theories, I couldn’t get up. He coaxed me out of bed with promises of light refracting off waves and briny winds, a sanctuary from the wildfire smoke. Walking hand-in-hand, our toes in the cold Pacific, I cried, finally allowing myself to feel the world’s weight. — Lilian Caylee Wang",Lilian Caylee Wang
127,2020-09-22T19:00:08+0000,‘Don’t Ever Lose This Rock’,"Six years ago, on a humid evening at an open-air bar in Vietnam, a tipsy acquaintance gave me a rock. She stole it from a potted plant, saying, “Don’t ever lose this rock.” Her goofy gesture made me blush. When I returned to the United States, we lost touch. I also lost touch with ease and intimacy in the following years, falling into bouts of unemployment, then unrelenting depression. But I did keep the rock. Each time I hold it, I remember that humid night — the feeling of belonging and excitement — and the potential to find it once again. — Ramzi Babouder-Matta",ever

They told him to leave. I do not have breath to cry. So I send him a picture of me in my hospital bed — in the hospital where I work as a nurse and likely got infected. I feel terrible. Covered in sweat, gasping. “I’m still here!” I text. Every day. Until I again have breath to cry. “Come take me home.” On wings, he did. — Lisa Menzie",Lisa Menzie
129,2020-09-22T19:00:08+0000,A Sweet Reminder,"We broke up all over New York City; no one block could see us through. I saw our split coming on Astor Place and on Greenpoint Avenue, too. One night we cried until our eyes were raw on the steps of an empty storefront in Williamsburg. The end was near, we knew. A few years and many failed first dates later, I noticed a frozen yogurt shop had moved into that empty storefront. Up the stairs, I crossed the threshold of our heartbreak and savored all the flavors inside. A sweet reminder of love, how one can never get enough. — Meg Christman",Meg Christman

But he taught me how to relate to my mother, which I never was able to do on my own. He buys me chocolate bunnies for Easter and chocolate cherries for Christmas. One year, Dave Dull made the best tasting sauerbraten for his own birthday party because no one else in my family knew how to make it. He served three tours in Vietnam flying rescue helicopters. He beats me at chess. I’ve come to learn, he’s pretty darn Bright. — Rhonda McCalla",Rhonda McCalla

Finding love as a 30-year-old gay man living in his parents’ basement on an Iowa dairy farm during a pandemic is impossible. Lying in darkness in a room with cement walls, I hear my parents upstairs. Last year they celebrated 40 years of marriage. Before my grandparents died, they celebrated 52. Should I download Grindr again? For the rural gays, that’s the best place to meet. But the closest profiles are miles away and they’re usually closeted married men. So I stay away. Lonely on acres of land, I dream of connection. — Jordon Deutmeyer",Jordon Deutmeyer
132,2020-09-15T19:00:08+0000,Division Decisions,"Years ago while away for the weekend, I woke up before my friend. In the refrigerator I found a small amount of orange juice and split it between two glasses. When she woke up and saw the juice she was surprised. She said that if her husband had found the orange juice, he would have poured it all in one glass for himself. I realized that if my husband had found the small amount of juice, he would have saved it all for me. We are still together; they are not. — Darah Latourelle",Darah Latourelle

He knows that I can’t carry or lift him, so he climbs into my lap. It worries me that he might only think of me as “Papa on the couch.” Yesterday, I got off the couch with difficulty. Before I knew it, my grandson came up behind me, placing his hands behind my knees. He helped me walk, using all of his 30 pounds to support me. I was in tears. What do children see, feel and understand? Everything. — Larry Zelnick",Larry Zelnick

A friend came to see me perform with her latest Bumble date. “You are crazy funny,” he said flirtatiously. Fellow Mustang drivers, we exchanged smiles as we roared off our separate ways. After my friend and the Bumble date broke up, I took him on, but it was no joke how bad we were together. I tried Bumble, connecting with a man who, coincidentally, I’d crossed paths with in New York and North Carolina. Funny how things work out. — Jennifer Zajac",Jennifer Zajac

They couldn’t afford a babysitter when I was a toddler, so most nights I went to work with them. To entertain me, they told funny stories about the people who occupied the offices by day. And when I grew tired, I slept on my father’s jacket on the floor while they mopped and vacuumed. I wrote a children’s book about that time called “The Paper Kingdom.” When we learned that my story would be published, it was the first time I saw my father cry. — Helena Ku Rhee",Helena Ku Rhee

There, I met John and felt an immediate spark, a sense of the extraordinary. But our conversation — and the party — ended. We met serendipitously over the years. John was never single. I gave up on love again. Then, hundreds of miles away in the High Sierra, I tried a new hiking trail. John appeared, also alone. Sensing the extraordinary, we finally kissed.

Miffed, she recounted this interaction to me over the phone. “I could have a good 20 years left!” My grandmother mails me homemade quilts. She cares daily for my disabled mother. She baked cookies for an entire hospital floor of nurses after her successful surgery. Her presence adds richness to the world. I dream of a future in which I can see her again, and in which others see her as more than expendable. — Shayna Fleming",Shayna Fleming
138,2020-09-08T19:00:44+0000,I Can Live Without Him,"There were “Thinking of you” roses, “Congratulations” roses and “Happy Birthday” roses. Adam sent me what he considered to be “I love you” roses, but I knew that they were “I’m busy” roses. He never spent a holiday with me, not even an anniversary, nor a moment to celebrate my academic milestones. Unknown to him, his flowers made me cry. Each bouquet reminded me of the loneliness he made me feel. How wondrous that now that I am single, I am no longer lonely. — Beatrice Talmage",Beatrice Talmage
139,2020-09-01T19:01:48+0000,What Best Friends Are For,"Stationed as an Army officer in Hawaii, I was alarmed to see my mother calling from Virginia. My father had a stroke. Feeling helpless more than 4,500 miles away, I called my best friend, Nora, an E.R. nurse who lives near them. Within 15 minutes, she drove to the hospital to hold hands, translate the doctor’s prognosis and make sure that my mother ate — everything a good nurse, or a good friend, would do. With my parents settled, I finally asked what had happened. “Oh,” Nora said with a giggle. “They were having sex.” I cringed, grateful for my friend. — Veronica Bean",Veronica Bean
140,2020-09-01T19:01:48+0000,‘Space and Silence’,"I was a shy, serious child, coached to “speak up” and “try new things.” I only wanted to read. My grandmother, Inger, worked in the rare book room of the Duke University library, at a desk surrounded by leather-bound volumes on tall shelves. That room smelled like heaven: slightly musty but sweet, with notes of parchment and sandalwood. I’d make a nest under her desk and curl up with a paperback. There among books by Milton and Audubon, I devoured “Stuart Little” and “Sounder.” She gave me space and silence, and I would give almost anything to sit beside her one more time. — Memsy Price",Memsy Price
141,2020-09-01T19:01:48+0000,Dating Advice From Dad,"After church, eating cinnamon buns at a diner in Carson City, Nev., I asked my father for dating advice. I was frustrated with the men I had met on apps. He chewed, nodded and smiled. A professor, my father relishes the opportunity to provide wisdom. “Abby, successful relationships are about shared values and companionship.” His words didn’t fully resonate until months later, when Laura approached me at work in the hospital’s courtyard while I was reading on lunch break. When she invited me to join her queer book club, my father’s words drowned out my cautious inner monologue. — Abby Yee",Abby Yee
142,2020-09-01T19:01:48+0000,Document of a Day,"Drive through my favorite stretch of the 101 freeway lined by a small eucalyptus grove, heading south toward sweet Pacific Grove, Calif. On the car stereo, Neil Young reminds me and Blake that “it’s gonna take a lot of love.” Rolling into Monterey, our pace slows from our usual college frenzy. Walk to a nearby monarch butterfly sanctuary then to the beach. Stand on the rocks just beyond the tide’s reach, sun waning. Blake documents our day in his notebook. I don’t react when I read that he thinks he is falling in love with me. Pretend I didn’t see it. — Chase Wilmot",Chase Wilmot
143,2020-08-25T19:00:08+0000,Sneaky Circle of Life,"Our house in Gloucestershire, England, is full of flowers that Dad buys for Mum. She’s allergic to lilies but adores every other kind of plant, tree or foliage. They fill our kitchen. Whenever a bunch of flowers dies, Mum delights in opening the windows and flinging the flowers onto the grass below to decompose and rejoin the earth. Dad knows flowers can’t decompose on the lawn but cannot bear to spoil Mum’s joy in being part of this circle of life. So, he sneaks outside, takes the dead flowers and puts them in the compost bin. — Lucy Hicks Beach",Lucy Hicks Beach
144,2020-08-25T19:00:08+0000,Bound by Groceries,"I first saw her, masked yet elegant, near the onions. She passed me by the lettuce with a gentle “Excuse me.” I passed her again by the squash. Then we found each other by the peaches. We both fumbled to open our plastic bags with plastic gloves on. Yet she seemed unfazed, almost peaceful. At the prepared foods counter, she ordered salmon, so I ordered salmon. I peered into her cart and noticed cherries, smiling at my matching bag. That was it. Two socially distant strangers, bound together by our bags of groceries. — Melissa M.P. Baldwin",Melissa M.P. Baldwin
145,2020-08-25T19:00:08+0000,‘The Bright Colors He Favored’,"We stood in our grandfather’s closet, five granddaughters taking in his treasures. Time advanced through the neat rows: Skinny ties replacing wider versions, oversized frames replacing sleeker ones. At the funeral we tied his silk scarves in our hair, around our wrists and throats, and spoke of how he made his love of life known in the bright colors he favored, the care with which he presented himself to the world. We each selected a pair of his glasses and one of his oversized sweatshirts, holding them close. Our treasures now. — Dayna Sason",Dayna Sason
146,2020-08-25T19:00:08+0000,When Leaving Is Loving,"I was having unrelenting, debilitating panic attacks. I had lost 10 pounds in 10 days. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t calm down. I asked my husband to leave for a week. I was afraid I would end up losing him over this, but I needed to be alone. At my request, he left, and in his absence, I calmed down. When he returned, I was grateful. I needed to be selfish, and he was able to be unselfish for me. It was the most loving thing he could have done. — Amy Goldmacher",Amy Goldmacher
147,2020-08-18T19:00:09+0000,‘I Can’t Believe You Heard Me’,"Three days into my coronavirus hellscape: It was 2 a.m. My sweet, sleep-deprived husband dozed in the living room of our Brooklyn apartment while I writhed in pain in our bed. As my temperature crept past 102 degrees, I couldn’t find the strength to get up for a cold compress. I called his name, hoping he was awake. I heard the floor creak under his footsteps. Relief washed over me. “I can’t believe you heard me,” I said. “Actually I didn’t,” he said. “The dog heard you.” My knights in shining armor. — Allie Ceccola",Allie Ceccola
148,2020-08-18T19:00:09+0000,"Boys, Bikinis and Cubed Fruit","I grew up with bowls of cut fruit — soft mangoes, vibrant dragon fruit. In our Chinese-American household, my parents chopped up big issues to make them easier for us to swallow. Misunderstandings sometimes led to raised voices — arguments fueled by generational divides, boys, bikinis, teenage selfishness. Sometimes misunderstandings led to silence. But there was always a bowl of cut fruit waiting. No problem, no question was too big to be sliced apart to eventually reach a core of understanding. Amid the cultural complexities of our Asian immigrant family, love is unspoken but unconditional in a bowl of neatly cubed apples. — Maggie Chen",Maggie Chen
149,2020-08-18T19:00:09+0000,The Iris Lenny Loved,"Inseparable for 73 years, my husband’s grandparents had a love I hope to emulate. They met on a double blind date. Lenny was supposed to fall for the other Iris, but fell for my husband’s grandmother Iris instead. When she died this April, we tried to soothe Lenny’s heartbreak with the only thing we had: Our six-foot gaze. Several weeks later, wanting to deliver cheer, we took our inflatable loungers to a patch of Park Avenue sidewalk. As we gossiped and grieved and greeted the passing neighbors, it felt like a modern version of Lenny’s Brooklyn stoop from long ago. — Lisa Sklar",Lisa Sklar
150,2020-08-18T19:00:09+0000,A Dual Diagnosis,"Sitting behind the one-way mirror as our child performed for a series of clinicians, we answered questions from psychiatrist, physician, therapists. Eventually, the diagnosis: Our child is autistic. As this sunk in, a second, more surprising revelation: My husband is autistic. A lifetime of quirkiness and misunderstanding contextualized. Now, when I grow exasperated with his brusqueness, his laser focus on idiosyncratic interests, the chaotic disarray of paperwork in his wake, I think of all the love and acceptance that I hope our child finds in the world. And it is a little easier to extend that love to them both.— Amanda Cissner",Amanda Cissner
151,2020-08-11T19:22:53+0000,Silence Is Its Own Answer,"Kim Jong-un wasn’t to blame. It turned out to be an employee error at the Hawaii Emergency Management Services that triggered a false North Korean missile alarm sent to those in the state, including my husband. He and his colleagues at the medical conference stopped discussing ocular herpes and took shelter. For 38 minutes, they faced their own imminent deaths. I wonder who he called or texted during that time; it wasn’t me. After a while, I couldn’t ignore what that silence told me. He didn’t even feel compelled to say goodbye to me, so that was goodbye. — Jennifer Byrne",Jennifer Byrne
152,2020-08-11T19:22:53+0000,A Man of Few Words,"My father’s words worked hard. He used as few as possible. “I love you,” I told him before I left for college. We were varnishing the gunwales of the canoe he had given me. “There’s a holiday,” he said, pointing to a spot I had missed. “I love you,” I told him as I pulled out of the driveway in an old car he had found. “You should say you love me back,” I said. “Write if you get work,” he said. “I love you,” I said when he was older and unwell. “That’s good,” he said, his eyes full of love and mischief. — Peggy Moss",Peggy Moss
153,2020-08-11T19:22:53+0000,Almost California Love,"Santa Barbara’s sunlight made the gold in Miguel’s eyes shimmer. Our gaze lingered. In Laguna Beach, he crooned Gipsy Kings to me at sunrise. Under a blazing Los Angeles sky, he thrust chrysanthemums into my sweaty hands, then disappeared. In San Luis Obispo, he taught me to salsa in the Madonna Inn Jacuzzi, our bodies glowing in the full moon. In Point Reyes, rain raged all afternoon, so we huddled in my car. In Stinson Beach, the sun appeared briefly for me to tell him I loved him. He embraced me and let me down gently as the sun set. — Dominic Laituri",Dominic Laituri
154,2020-08-11T19:22:53+0000,A Gift That Keeps Growing,"A well-meaning neighbor dropped off sourdough starter and a list of recipes, unannounced. “We just fed it,” he said. “You should be good to make pizza dough in about four hours.” We made the dough (what other option did we have?) and sent a picture as evidence. Soon I was feeding our “baby” twice a day, and making either pizza, crackers, bread or muffins around the clock (or so it seemed). The last recipe from his list? Cinnamon rolls. I made them today and they were delicious. We brought the rest to our neighbors. Who else? — Liz Zito",Liz Zito
155,2020-08-04T19:00:09+0000,Ambulance Songs,"I can’t help but notice the increasing frequency of Isabella singing “Wee-woo, wee-woo!” It took me a moment to realize that my 19-month-old was imitating the sounds of ambulances as they passed. We’ve become accustomed to them screaming down the streets toward Tucson Medical Center. Isabella now sings the ambulance song four, five, six times a day. Spinning with both arms raised, she projects unmitigated toddler joy at those loud, flashy boxes that roll by day and night. Every unlucky person transported past our home gets an ambulance song dedicated to them. I hope it helps. — Amber Gates",Amber Gates
156,2020-08-04T19:00:09+0000,Learning From Each Other,"We met on a St. Patrick’s Day blind date. I partied, got drunk and passed out on our friend’s couch. He thought I was beautiful. We married six months later. He is the grandson of a Klansman. His parents disowned him because I am Black; my parents accepted him. We had two sons. I almost left him three times. He was often an impatient, temperamental know-it-all. I was often too passive, insecure and private. Over 40 years, I taught him to quiet his temper and listen to others. He taught me to speak up and be stronger. We are committed. — Jacquelyn Jobe",Jacquelyn Jobe

She led me downstairs, where she had spelled “I love you” with cards on the floor. Eyes red and puffy, I smiled for the first time all day. Nine years later, when she was 15, her first boyfriend broke up with her. I did the only thing I could to help. I wrote “I love you” in playing cards at the bottom of the stairs. Eyes red and puffy, she smiled. — Devon Burger",Devon Burger
158,2020-08-04T19:00:09+0000,The Tree,"My mother died at almost 95, and I needed to walk to the tree. That’s what my son would say after we planted a Texas redbud in Riverside Park 18 years ago. His father had died two years before, when my son was 4. Many times since we have held onto a branch and cried or stayed quiet. I talked to the tree when my son wouldn’t talk to me. I walked to the tree today and it was gone. My soul ached. Disease? Storm? I wanted to ask the tree. Without answers, we will plant another. — Patty Dann",Patty Dann

At 5, I asked her, “Are you Allah?” She seemed to know everything. Little did either of us know that we were driving three towns over for these ducks, passing dozens of parks (with ducks) along the way. Now, I’m 26.

I, a white, high school English teacher writing a novel about interracial love in the American south. Suddenly, people are dying and we are driving to Atlanta.

161,2020-07-28T20:32:39+0000,My Job to Call,"After I left home for boarding school at 14, my parents never called to talk. We spoke often, but it was my job to dial: from Toronto (high school) to Philadelphia (college) to England (graduate school) to New York (my current home). Daughter: pursuer. Parents: pursued. When they did call, I was terrified that someone had died. If I went absent for weeks, testing their resolve, they called to confirm I was alive. But recently, they complained about not speaking to my children enough. Now, every Sunday morning, my phone rings and it’s them. — Maayan Dauber",Maayan Dauber
162,2020-07-28T20:32:39+0000,A Story That Bloomed,"My family’s farm in the west of Ireland had a giant honeysuckle. When sent to the spring well, I would set down my bucket to smell the blossoms. When I was 10 and we left the farmhouse for the nearby village, the honeysuckle was the only thing I missed. Yesterday, in America, I noticed a honeysuckle outside my office window. When had Ken planted it? When had I told him? In a trans-Atlantic marriage, there are so many departures and datelines, so many tales to tell. My story of the honeysuckle must have taken root in Ken’s mind, and bloomed. — Áine Greaney",Áine Greaney
163,2020-07-21T19:00:07+0000,Waiting Out the Storm,"Pigeons arrived on our fire escape, grooming one another. A couple. Affectionate. But they weren’t pigeons. There was something un-pigeonly about them. My wife called them “generic birds.” Search: “generic, monogamous birds of N.Y.C.” We discovered: “Morning doves!” No, actually: “Mourning doves,” named after their gray feathers and melancholy song. I play a recording of their plaintive call. One cocks its head in recognition. (My wife thinks he was looking at a tree.) We sit inside. They sit outside. Bonded pairs waiting out this storm, listening to ambulance sirens mix with the sound of mourning. — Scott Illingworth",Scott Illingworth

He picked me up from the Atlanta airport in a limo with a bottle of champagne. I loved him immediately and as recklessly as he’d probably once loved her. “I always wanted you,” he said, his musician’s voice so different from that of Eugene, the Irish Catholic father who raised me. I studied my birth-father’s long hair, broad shoulders, calloused fingers and nose that dipped like mine. He isn’t perfect, I learned. But he’s the only man who’s written me a song. — Erin Carpenter",Erin Carpenter

After 28 years living under different roofs, they decided to shelter together during lockdown — much to the surprise of my family. From our video calls, I catch glimpses of their laughter and gentle teasing. I smile watching them on the same screen as they tell me about their daily walks and budding herbs in their Montreal garden. Their happy cohabitation is a silver lining, but it makes me wonder: Why didn’t they stay together all this time? — Kat Chan",Kat Chan

Before we left the shelter, everyone came to say goodbye. A week after his homecoming, Chips stopped eating. I brought him to the hospital and found out he has leukemia — which is to say, he is still on his way to somewhere else. The bright striped tent is always packed up a little too fast. Meet my old cat, Chips. He was only here for a bit. When he left, everyone came to say goodbye. — Mo David",Mo David
167,2020-07-14T19:00:08+0000,Narrowing Our Social Distance,"The driving rain hit her train window and streamed two rows back across mine. The depth of her grief was impossible to contain within six feet of social distance. It spilled over. Too on edge to listen to music, I overheard her story unfold through phone calls as we crossed Connecticut: Early that morning, heart attack, her father won’t walk her down the aisle. I bore silent, masked witness to the heaviest moment of her life. On Amtrak 2167, I absorbed an ounce of her pain. Now, I will carry it for her, a stranger’s burden in a strange world. — Hannah Sands",Hannah Sands

Both twice divorced with children, we felt our meeting was kismet. Yet, our relationship crumbled under the weight of our past pain. I scrutinized her affection, wanting her to express her care and commitment. She withdrew, cautious and needing time to trust. We gave up, but her hair didn’t. Strands of beautiful silver hair clung to my clothes, car, sheets. Mocking and reminding me of who I was losing. After many sessions of individual and couples counseling, we re-emerged, together. — Darrell Hill",Darrell Hill
169,2020-07-14T19:00:08+0000,One Thing I Didn’t Expect About Motherhood,"How much I would think about bodies. My body. My children’s bodies. The way they grow, stretch, scar and heal. Their softness and their strength. Through pregnancy, birth and recovery, I’ve become more forgiving toward my body, though it hasn’t always felt like mine. Its changes aren’t easy to accept, nor are the demands to share it so frequently. I marvel at my children, so awkward and elegant. Why are we drawn to embrace so often? Why does touch offer such comfort? I am not religious, but since becoming a mother, I have learned to worship. Our bodies are holy. — Kristan Hoffman",Kristan Hoffman

He walked out of my bedroom to put on his shoes, left by the couch the night before. Mid-walk, he paused and looked at me, his face thoughtful, almost amused. “What?” I asked, suddenly self-conscious, unsure of what he saw. He closed the gap between us and kissed me. “Nothing,” he said gently, and proceeded to put on his shoes. Months after our break up, I find myself thinking of that moment. “What?” my roommate says with a curious expression. “Nothing,” I say. — Jenna Grande",Jenna Grande
171,2020-07-07T19:14:31+0000,‘A More Annoying Version of Myself’,"The night I met my best friend, Bhavya, we clashed over feminism and plastic surgery. I would go on to describe her as “a more annoying version of myself.” A year later, we argued about the apartment we would move into. We worked our way through medical school, and all the while, we argued: Medical specialties. Netflix shows. Politics. Ice cream. Men. Impostor syndrome. Despite the fights, she would always say, “Stop underestimating yourself; you’re brilliant.” Someday, she will ask me, “How did you meet him?” But for now, let me tell how lucky I am to have met her. — Areej Ali",Areej Ali

Her face was tired, as if she had endured a long night, but that didn’t stop her from illuminating the hospital room. She walked with confidence, loved peanut butter like me. She wanted to save the world by using her plastic knife over and over again. But she could never be mine. I would never see her again. What more is love than a heart set on fire, left to burn? — Rose Paine, 13 years old","Rose Paine, 13 years old"

After my mother cared for my finger, determining that there was no need to visit the E.R., I joked about what this lost chunk might mean for my fingerprints while my sweet father cried. “Dad,” I said, “I’m totally fine.” “I know,” he said. “It just makes me sad watching you get hurt.” — Ana Michels",Ana Michels

I asked my son, Ian, to help me make dinner. “Why is Della struggling so?” I said. “I think she’s upset because we have too many chores,” Ian replied. My single-mother temperature rose, and I spoke angrily to the messenger: “There won’t be fewer chores.” Stirring pasta and folding laundry, I sobbed as Ian and Della came close. Della squeezed my hand. “It’s OK, Mama,” she said. “I’m here.” Ian hugged my waist. “We all melt down sometimes.” I received their compassion with gratitude. — Jennifer Iverson",Jennifer Iverson

Twenty-one years of no longer imagining, I speak to my own children about mortality. Like I did, they resist imagining a world without their mother. Yet I hope they’ll remember my words. Recently, I’ve taken to socially distant walks in the local cemetery. There, I breathe in lilacs and remember days with my mother. — Kathy Curto",Kathy Curto

My younger brother, Nick, revealed the pain he felt because I hadn’t opposed our extended family’s homophobic comments. Despite my efforts to show my brother solidarity through online activism, I had remained silent when our cousin questioned and judged his sexuality. Nick and I are both adopted from Russia, so we know firsthand that family is not defined by blood but by commitment and love. I was ashamed.

Andrew scooped me in his arms and carried me to shore as I tried not to cry. We had just moved to America from Canada and were homesick. The hospital was so expensive; at home, it’s free. Andrew wheeled me through the halls in his wet suit, slipping, looking like Aquaman, refusing to leave my side. The nurses smiled and laughed.

She tells me the coronavirus was started by the Illuminati. I ask her about Santiago, Chile, in the summer. I rarely speak with my grandmother even though we live only miles away. She’s easy to love, as most grandmothers are, but hard to like. I see the worst of myself in her: a cruelty, an impending bipolar diagnosis. How can I make peace with this?

One night, post-fight, I remembered reading an article with the headline, “Fighting About the Dishes? It Might Be About Something Else.” The mandatory confinement in our small Berlin apartment created a crisis in our relationship. The entire world seemed to be in crisis, too. Anxious, I Googled “crisis.” It was characterized as a “crossroad,” a “turning point when an important change takes place.” I relaxed, realizing that our situation could be a chance for a better start, both for our relationship and the world. — Natalia Lomaia",Natalia Lomaia

Then — poof — he was at home, alone and unhappy until his school transitioned to online learning. My daughter FaceTimed me during his first Zoom class. “Mom, look at this,” she said. “Total confusion. All noise. No one knows where the mute button is.” She was watching chaos, but I saw love.

Months later, it felt as if we were a couple, with our daily check-ins and confessions, but we weren’t. He couldn’t give me more. With one fight, it was over. In 2017, Chris was diagnosed with brain cancer. I emailed. He downplayed his illness but asked if I wanted his books. “Yes,” I said.

Throughout my childhood, she feared elastic underwear cutting off my circulation, pesticides, undercooked meat, idling cars, flea collars, germs and the cleansers that kill them. My response was frank. “If you get this virus, you’ll go into a hospital and there’s a good chance you’ll die there, alone.” We registered each other’s fear.

The world is finally realizing that he’s “essential.” While Alex’s uniform may protect him from extrajudicial profiling, it also endangers him, requiring him to be exposed to the coronavirus. He’s always had to be tough, but since living with his girlfriend, he’s changed. Alex now tells my parents and me that he loves us. Out loud. I remember this change in myself when I first fell in love. Alex and I are 3,000 miles apart, but we’ve never been closer. — Kimberly Reyes",Kimberly Reyes
184,2020-06-16T19:00:10+0000,"After Truly Seeing Me, He Didn’t Flee","“What’s that?” he asked, pointing to the sign in my room that read “Boobs Not Bones.” He was the first friend (crush) I’d brought home since recovering from disordered eating behavior. At the start of my sophomore year of high school, I had already put in so much work: therapy to grapple with my father’s sudden death and my destructive fixation on weight. I even joined the marching band to make friends, where I met this friend (crush) who I now expected to high-tail out of my room and life. Instead, he gave me a long hug and became my love. — Markella Wagner",Markella Wagner
185,2020-06-16T19:00:10+0000,Toasting Our Survival,"My 95-year-old mother and her 94-year-old partner of 22 years had just polished off a bottle of wine, their first since surviving coronavirus. Although they are both still sharp-minded and independent, their illness was frightening for our entire family. After a month of debilitating symptoms, they recovered. When they called me, they were in a tipsy, celebratory state of bliss. “We just want to make sure you know how much we love each other, how precious our love is,” they said. Then they said they had to hang up “so we can give each other a kiss.” — Siri Smith",Siri Smith
186,2020-06-16T19:00:10+0000,Welcoming a Little Change,"I saw a box of golden raisins at the store and thought, “We haven’t had those in a while. They might be a nice change.” Last year, my husband had a heart attack and was given an arterial stent. I recently was tested for uterine cancer (negative, but still). We’re anxious about our children, our parents, money, health insurance, coronavirus, and the violence and injustice in the world. But one morning I make my husband’s oatmeal and ask if he wants any golden raisins. “Oh,” he says, “we haven’t had those in a while. They might be a nice change.” — Sarah Cords",Sarah Cords
187,2020-06-09T19:06:31+0000,Grateful to Have Her Home,"My parents, Tibetan refugees, made a life in America, raising me and my three sisters in Queens, New York. My mother has been a nanny for six families, caring for a total of 11 children. Most of my life, I felt competition for her time, energy and affection. I used to resent when she would share pictures and stories of the children she cared for, but gradually I realized she needed to discuss her work like anyone with a full-time job. Now, as we giggle at the photos, I ask follow-up questions and feel grateful to be home with her. — Tenzin Wangmo",Tenzin Wangmo
188,2020-06-09T19:06:31+0000,How to Recall a Life?,"How to recall my grandfather’s 97 years? There was the voyage from Nazi-occupied Poland to Siberia, Uzbekistan, Paris and Cuba, ending in the Bronx. Along the way, he sold soap on the black market, posed as a Soviet officer, was a D.J. for Cuban-Jewish radio, learned eight languages, worked at bakeries, operated a dry-cleaning business, got married and had two children, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Coronavirus kept us grandchildren from attending his funeral, so we video chatted to remember a man born without electricity, recalling his obsession with punctuality and ill-fitting baseball caps, recounting his dirty jokes and survival stories. — Rebecca Julie",Rebecca Julie
189,2020-06-09T19:06:31+0000,In Between,"He was a bartender; I waited tables at a neighboring bar. After years of acquaintanceship, I asked him out. An evening turned to morning. He hummed happily in my ear. We loved one another but we were lazy, unwilling to work on our relationship. After three years, things fell apart. On the last day in our shared home, he held me in the same bed as the first night, humming softly. Those two nights felt like bookends: one of thrilling joy, the other of terrifying grief. In the middle, it was all love. For me, it always will be. — Lucia Skinner De Gregorio",Lucia Skinner De Gregorio
190,2020-06-09T19:06:31+0000,Perfectly Aligned for Three Months,"I met Ashlyn the summer after my freshman year of college. We worked as housekeepers on a Wyoming ranch. Ashlyn had debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which helped her excel at her job but also could make her an insufferable co-worker. She took me under her wing and taught me, eventually becoming my friend. As our three months together ended, she thanked me neither for our bond nor our memories, but for setting the silverware the way she liked: the knives and forks perfectly aligned. “No one notices,” she said, “but I do.” — Katherine Yao",Katherine Yao
191,2020-06-02T19:31:01+0000,Single Dad Lockdown,"I’m trapped in the house with Tenzing, my 6-year-old son. I cook vegetables for him, set up Zoom classes, play Monopoly Junior. He wants to pillow fight when I’m working, ride on my back when I’m reading. Does he watch too much YouTube? Should we sneak into the playground? When will this end? It’s a relief when his mother picks him up for her four days. But as soon as he’s gone, I call her to ask how he’s doing. I’d rather have him driving me crazy than feel his absence in this house. — Ranjan Adiga",Ranjan Adiga
192,2020-06-02T19:31:01+0000,Never Too Old for Butterflies,"A man shows up at my nonprofit. He appears to be more interested in me than in his volunteer tasks. “I’m in a committed relationship,” I tell him the third time he comes back. He asks, “Why aren’t you happy?” Huh? I have a house, children, dog and retirement account. “I’m fine,” I reply. I’m almost 60, too old for these butterflies. Too old to remake my life. A close friend dies in a motorcycle accident. He always asked me why I put myself last. Was I happy? Six years with my new love and life, I’ve never been so happy. — Susan Murphy",Susan Murphy
193,2020-06-02T19:31:01+0000,A Gleeful Scream on Graduation Day,"Although I woke up 1,667 miles from my university on graduation day, I was greeted with diploma-shaped balloons, a whiteboard emblazoned with “Congratulations!” and childhood pictures plastered across my bedroom door. The morning continued with freshly made masala dosa and culminated with my parents competing to take a picture of my graduation slide as my name was read. My mother’s face fell when she thought she’d missed it. Upon discovering that she had captured the moment, she let out a gleeful scream. As we hugged, I decided not to mention that our online graduation was being fully recorded. — Julie Thamby",Julie Thamby
194,2020-06-02T19:31:01+0000,The World From Our Window,"May 25, 2020, was our second anniversary. Thinking about our wedding feels like staring into the sun — so brilliant that it hurts. In photos we embrace people more freely than it seems we ever will again. But I know that’s not true. This afternoon, the street outside our Brooklyn window is closed to traffic. We spend the day watching a girl learn to ride her bike. Then another joins her. Their little circles, slowly getting wide, are a comfort. We’ll have ease again. Until then, I have a person to join me at the window and watch the world. — Lindsay Vranizan",Lindsay Vranizan
195,2020-05-26T19:00:20+0000,When Lies Turn Into Prophecies,"A very drunk man won’t stop telling me about trains. The Cape Town summer is hot, the night sticky, my drink warm. This gay bar will surely sink, given the number of heaving bodies shoved inside it. I nod at the train-talker, plotting an escape, and you appear. Your accent is cute, your beard cuter, and you tell the train guy that we’re here together. Suddenly, we are here together. It isn’t a lie; it’s a prophecy, and a good one at that. Ten years, three countries, five cities, four dogs and two toddlers later, we’re still here, together. — Michael McClelland",Michael McClelland
196,2020-05-26T19:00:20+0000,It Could’ve Been a Fling,"We were staying at the same Airbnb, full of foreigners in the north of New Zealand, hoping to make money picking kiwi fruit (an open, essential business during coronavirus). We crossed paths often in the kitchen: seven people dodging each other to make coffee and cook breakfast before driving to the orchards. He was always shirtless. One night, I watched a movie with him and his friends. He sat close to me. Was that on purpose? Finally, I talked to him, for hours, the day his roommate came back, precluding any privacy. I said, “I’m leaving tomorrow.” He said, “That’s sad.” Shoot. — Serena Runyan",Serena Runyan
197,2020-05-26T19:00:20+0000,Missing Him,"My husband urged me to pull over. I was sobbing, an increasingly regular occurrence. “I can’t do this without you,” I said. “You can,” he said. “Lots of people do.” “But we’re supposed to grow old and crusty together!” “You get to grow old and crusty,” he said. Then, his smile fading: “I want you to know it’s OK if you meet someone. Be open to the possibility.” Violent head shake. “Nope, you’ve ruined me for other men.” Pat on my knee, that beaming smile back, “You’ve ruined me too, dear.” How I miss you. — Stephanie Martin Glennon",Stephanie Martin Glennon
198,2020-05-26T19:00:20+0000,His Comfort Becomes Mine,"Every night, my 3-year-old, Rohaan, insists on falling asleep with his palm on my cheek. Sometimes, his hand smells of glue and balloons. Sometimes, he wakes during the night and again demands, “Hand on your face.” When I can, I sneak away to read articles, statistics, the history of the 1918 pandemic’s end, accounts of coronavirus patients dying alone. I try to understand what I can’t. Exhausted, I return to bed, squeezing in between my husband and toddler. Listening to the new quiet of Karachi, Pakistan, I place Rohaan’s small palm back on my cheek and find sleep. — Zofishan Umair",Zofishan Umair
199,2020-05-19T19:00:09+0000,Everything New for You,"Barbecue. Introduction, joke, smile. Friend request, message sent. First date: loud restaurant, easy conversation. Second date: “Sushi?” Who cares if I’ve never eaten it; I’ll try it for you. Third date: meeting your friends. I’m not too social, but for you I’ll try to be. “This isn’t serious,” I say. “This isn’t serious,” we say. One, two, three, four, five years pass. “This still isn’t serious.” Who wants to be serious? Still don’t know what to expect, but why obsess over expectations? I will still try everything new for you. Because I love you. — Aleks Fedoriw",Aleks Fedoriw
200,2020-05-19T19:00:09+0000,A Revelation on Mother’s Day,"My mother is doting on my 11-year-old brother, who is 12 years younger than me. Teasing, I say, “How come you never told me you were proud of me like you tell Caleb?” She says, “I have two regrets about your childhood. First, not showing up at your recitals because I was too exhausted from work. Second, never expressing how precious you are. Motherhood is a learning process; I’m trying to be better this time.” Taken aback, I say, “Look how excellently I turned out anyway!” But inside, I feel something untwist and heal in my heart. — Iris Kim",Iris Kim
201,2020-05-19T19:00:09+0000,‘I’m Going to Rest Now’,"In mid-March, my friend Bob and I were discussing which soups were digestible, which treatments could fight his lymphedema, which chemotherapy might get him to his son’s 16th birthday. A week later, in self-isolation, he texts that there was nothing left to try, sending an uncharacteristic crying emoji. Then a final message: “I’m going to rest now.” My last visit was clouded by shock and the fear of coronavirus infection. Bob lay there, barely breathing, emaciated. I lost my resolve not to weep in front of his wife and child, held his hand and said goodbye. — Kristin Triff",Kristin Triff
202,2020-05-19T19:00:09+0000,A Hard-Earned Moment in the Sun,"Did I ever mention what a tough but generous woman my Grandma Kay was? After working as a coil winder for Midwest Coil and later as a secretary at Mutual Scrap Metal, she took a Chicago Transit Authority bus to and from our household of six children to help our mother, five days a week. After wiping bottoms, mopping floors and making beds for six unappreciative brats, Grandma Kay would sit on the porch savoring her cigarette while sipping an ice-cold glass bottle of Pepsi, barefoot, with her face toward the sun. — Fatima Tucker",Fatima Tucker
203,2020-05-12T19:00:08+0000,A 30-Year Gaze,"When you were 18 and I was 17, and I decided to leave high school, my grandmother asked for a picture of me for her bookshelf. She wanted a portrait to place next to the framed photos of her other grandchildren, all smiling in caps and gowns. I gave her the picture that you had taken in the field behind my house, cropped to hide my unbuttoned dress, my splotchy chest. Although our relationship didn’t last, for the next 30 years I had to look at a picture of me looking at you. — Bethany Dorau",Bethany Dorau
204,2020-05-12T19:00:08+0000,‘Anything to Care for Her Again’,"Friends and family have said, with some hesitation, that they’re glad Cathy, my wife of 33 years, did not live past November. I, too, have said I am relieved she didn’t have to endure A.L.S. during the coronavirus, with her assistants, feeding tubes and breathing machines. But on what would have been her 71st birthday this past Mother’s Day, I understood that even though I was relieved — not for her or our two children, but for me as her caregiver — I also would give anything to care for her again. — Steve Zoloth",Steve Zoloth
205,2020-05-12T19:00:08+0000,"Looking Up, Looking Down","We met on a swing in Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1969. I looked at her with awe, my very own sister, as the swing swayed back and forth while my parents talked to the social worker. On the drive back home, I held Dori in my arms and fed her a baby bottle full of milk. She looked up at me with awe. Now she looks down at my 5-foot-5 frame from her stature of 5-foot-10. When we hug, her long arms envelop me and lift me off the ground. From the day we met, I have loved my big little sister. — Hillary Younglove",Hillary Younglove
206,2020-05-12T19:00:08+0000,‘I Bake to See That Smile Again’,"I bake because she is losing things: senior year, prom, graduation, lazy days with her boyfriend, friends at the shore. I bake because I can’t make it better and I can’t say when it will stop. I bake because the sweetness of the bread, banana or pumpkin, brings her to the kitchen. I bake because momentary comfort is all my hands and heart can give her. I bake because she is young and should be free, unburdened by loss. I bake because she smiled at three weeks and never stopped, until now. I bake to see that smile again. — Beth Apone Salamon",Beth Apone Salamon
207,2020-05-05T19:00:09+0000,Held Together by Dots,"Two dots each, mine vertical and my sister’s horizontal. When Shuchi and I were growing up, our mother used to mark “our dots” on our underwear so she could tell them apart in the laundry. Now we have them tattooed on our wrists — not to keep us apart, but to show that we are always together. — Richa Chaturvedi",Richa Chaturvedi
208,2020-05-05T19:00:09+0000,Sharing Cities,"The third time Tolani’s profile popped up, I messaged her. (Cute smile. Funny caption. Why not?) We hung out every night that she was in Los Angeles, my hometown. I learned that she lived in Atlanta, a city I had called my own for 14 years and missed dearly. For months, we dated long distance, spending six days in each other’s homes before kissing goodbye. When the coronavirus descended, we decided to shelter together. (New love. An opportunity to nurture it. Why not?) Now, we hope, our cohabitation will never end. — Saniyyah Griffin",Saniyyah Griffin
209,2020-05-05T19:00:09+0000,My Father’s Love Language,"The first time my father told me “I love you,” he was in a hospital bed, hooked up to IV fluids and beeping machines. Cancer had transformed him into a fragile man who might take flight with the slightest wind. Standing by him as evening descended over New York City, I recognized little of the man who shoveled our entire driveway and hoisted me onto his shoulders. When he uttered those words, I was angry; it felt like a resignation. Yet, even at 17, I understood: He spoke his love because he could no longer love through action. — Jessalyn Li",Jessalyn Li
210,2020-05-05T19:00:09+0000,“Who’s There?”,"My 88-year-old mother looks at the screen, squinting. “Who’s there, you say?” My brother explains that the boxes frame her other children. Three thousand miles away, in Chicago, I wait for my 97-year-old father to sit down. Zoom, coronavirus, Lima, Chicago, Florida and dementia collide on our screens. I usually travel to Peru every other month to care for my parents. Without international flights, I feel as lost as my mother. I shoo away questions that start with “What if…?” Today, when my mother asks, “Who’s there?” I say, “Tu hija.” (“Your daughter.”) She smiles. I do too. — Ana Ubilluz Colomb",Ana Ubilluz Colomb

The night he was born in Gimhae, South Korea, a typhoon blew in from the Sea of Japan. “Am I in labor?” Yiseon asked, hunched over a beanbag chair. “I can’t tell.” We left so late, flying down the rain-slicked neon boulevards to the clinic, that there wasn’t time for an epidural, or any painkiller other than a midwife’s massage. I had peppermint oil and blood on my hands when we first heard him cry. Outside, the storm stripped ginkgos bare, burying the sidewalks under damp gold leaves. — Joshua Cornwell",Joshua Cornwell
212,2020-04-28T20:06:47+0000,Strangers on a Train,"We met on a train from Paris to Barcelona. Sitting next to one another, we argued over who could use the power outlet. “Désolé, je crois que c’est a moi.” (“Sorry, I think it’s mine.”) Instant crush. A perfect, flirtatious, six hours. The beginning of our love story? We agreed to meet back in Paris: On March 19, I’d wait for his train at the Gare de Lyon railway station. We didn’t know that coronavirus would confine us in different countries. Trusting in the power of the universe, we hadn’t exchanged mobile numbers. Sometimes, a romantic plan isn’t enough. — Cecilia Pesao",Cecilia Pesao
213,2020-04-28T20:06:47+0000,“Rich in Love and Wonder”,"My grandmother Ricka taught me flower names in her garden: snapdragon, iris, tulip. She lived in coal country, but beauty bloomed there. Her bread came from the coal stove that heated the house. Floors, even in the bedrooms, were linoleum. Each visit, I chose fabric and a pattern, and she made me a dress. One Christmas, she sent some doll clothes created from scraps of all the dresses she had made for me. I was enchanted. Her life was one of poverty, but I was unaware. To me, it was rich in love and wonder. — Donna Fowler",Donna Fowler
214,2020-04-28T20:06:47+0000,Together at the Day’s End,"Amy made room for me in her bed. “Mama, read,” she said, resting her head on my shoulder. Her eyelashes brushed my collarbone. The sensation soothed me. I never skimp on Amy’s bedtime story. After a day of “Get dressed,” “Eat your waffles,” “Zip your coat” and “Tidy your toys,” there were only the words on the page. The last 15 minutes of Amy’s day were the first time I was present for her, and I seized them. Joining her in her imagination, I did the voices, made the faces. I offered her my body to lie on. — Jennifer Cinguina",Jennifer Cinguina
215,2020-04-21T19:15:07+0000,Escaping for Seven Minutes,"I call my grandma, haunted by the image of her in assisted living without visitors. “You sound even more beautiful than last time I saw you,” she says. Because of her Alzheimer’s, she forgets when that was, but she never forgets her adoration for my sister, Marissa, and me, her “M&Ms.” In her world, there’s no pandemic outside. For our seven-minute conversation, there’s none in mine either. “I’m so happy you called,” she says. “Now I can go to bed with a smile.” Four days later, she’s gone.

From my parents, I carried the assumption that only the grand gesture is proof of love.

217,2020-04-21T19:15:07+0000,When Half Turns to Full,"My first children and first loves (girl, then boy) were born when I was just 23 and 25. Before their teenage years, they lived through a lifetime with me: divorce, second marriage, law degree and career. When I was pregnant again at 37, I braced myself every time someone asked my teenage daughter about the looming arrival of her sister. “My half sister,” she would correct. But when her sister was born, we all fell in love. The full replaced the half: full of love, full of joy, full of song. We haven’t stopped singing. — Angie Jones",Angie Jones
218,2020-04-21T19:15:07+0000,An Expression for the End,"“A-law.” This phrase, like many others, is from my father’s Appalachian roots. It means, “What do you expect?” or “I should’ve known.” As a girl, I was embarrassed by my father’s work-worn hands, hesitation to read aloud and lack of formal education. (He left school in sixth grade to work, first as a peddler, then in a quarry.) While waiting for his life’s end at 92, he found little joy in the long days. He hadn’t thought that death would come for him, but as he accepted the inevitable, he would catch my eye, smile slightly and deliver a perfect “A-law!” — Mary Kennedy Brown",Mary Kennedy Brown

With the time lost to treatment, arguments and constant worry, the garden had been abandoned. My daughter, with her late-April birthday, didn’t realize how painful the memories were. Yet, I began — pulling weeds, turning soil, planting seeds as my hands bled and I wept. Today, a daisy bloomed and tomatoes appeared. Though the garden is a gift for my daughter, I thank her. — Tom Sunstrom",Tom Sunstrom

Laced up her sneakers. “Please don’t go; I’ll sleep it off.” I begged her to not go out into the desolate and dark Brooklyn night. She ran a mile each way to the 24-hour drugstore. When she returned safe and sweaty, she burst in and said for the first time, “I love you. This is what I’m here for.” — Kendra Kobler",Kendra Kobler

My family didn’t have much money while living in India, but whenever I asked, “Whose happy birthday is it?” my uncle, Shyam, would say it was his, then splurge on a little slice of cake. Now I live in the United States, in Houston; there is a pandemic and most bakeries are closed. My uncle died alone in a hospital in Hyderabad; he was only 50. All I can do is sit alone in my room, crying, eating cake. I will always love him more than I love cake. — Kaarthika Thakker",Kaarthika Thakker

I selected the first photo: Two-year-old me, smiling wide, nestled in his arms. I felt nostalgia, guilt, then sadness. I started to text him back but couldn’t find the words. Over the years we had constructed a wall between us, strengthened by every guarded exchange and words left unsaid about our Asian immigrant family, my queer identity.

The people behind us are a little too close. He’s wearing the jacket that my father gave him. I laugh, pull him toward me, say, “This is the dumbest fight I’ve ever been in.” He nods, kisses me.

While our worlds condense into two-hour sleep stretches and 2,000 square feet of self-isolation, our daughter’s world continues to expand. We find solace in her small wonders: her fingers tracing the lines of our faces, her delight in the guitar, our silly dancing, the range of her newfound voice. Today, there is hope in her tiny universe. We hold it fiercely. — Charity Yoro",Charity Yoro

Last April, he was unresponsive in terminal care, cancer having metastasized to his brain. By his bedside I conducted the Seders on the two requisite evenings. He did not react, except for once during the second Seder. They say hearing is the last sense to go. As I sang his favorite song from the Haggadah, Stanley’s tears were a powerful demonstration of this being so. He died 23 hours after the second Seder, not wanting to miss either one. — Zelda R.

Two teenagers later, with more gray hair than I ever imagined, we feel as uncertain about life as we did back then. Now, in our too-big home in Harare, Zimbabwe, we are not holding hands (my husband is quarantining after travel).

On an early spring day that brought Chicago outside, we exchanged numbers at the end of an ultimate Frisbee game and made plans to meet again. But then the bars, restaurants and coffee shops closed. So we adapted. We dated on my couch and across my kitchen table. We picked up takeout, alternated secret glances over a puzzle, ate cinnamon pancakes. We didn’t talk about the pandemic until, lying in bed, we laughed at our sudden and unexpected domestic intimacy, entwined while quarantined. — Madison Moore",Madison Moore
228,2020-03-31T19:22:04+0000,Washing Hair in the Kitchen Sink,"I watched her head dip beneath the faucet. Her aged hands fumbled with the hot and cold. Light poured in through the kitchen window. Afterward, her shirt was damp, her hair clean, and she thanked me for standing next to her in case she fell. I was filled with love. As an educator, I know: We must help one another while honoring each other’s independence. I can only hope that someday someone will be standing next to me, and that someday I can be as beautiful as my grandmother washing her hair in the kitchen sink. — Sara Tennyson",Sara Tennyson
229,2020-03-31T19:22:04+0000,Needing to Pull Away,"My granddaughter, Annie, is 21 months old. We’ve enjoyed hours of ordinary time together: sharing picnics, holding hands, snuggling with books. Then the virus came. Now, Annie toddles toward me expecting to be scooped up only to have me keep space between us. She reaches for my hand only to have me refrain. She wraps her arms around my legs, wanting help with her shoe, only to have me pass the privilege to her mother. Confusion rests on Annie’s face. Does she feel rejected? What does this pulling away mean to her? Will our days of warm embraces return? — Ruthie Douglass",Ruthie Douglass
230,2020-03-31T19:22:04+0000,Some Reassembly May Be Required,"It’s a fun game, testing the durability of our love with hypotheticals — the scariest being those that might actually happen. We worry about gradual annoyances, inevitable disagreements. Now, practicing social isolation in separate apartments, I ask what would happen if he forgets me during our time apart. His reply? “We’ll just get to fall in love all over again.” What I didn’t know I needed to hear: a reassurance not that we will stay forever intact but that we can rebuild if we shatter. — Angie Kang",Angie Kang
231,2020-03-24T19:00:10+0000,Escaping to Before,"If a pandemic cancels the remainder of your spring semester, and your recent ex decides to suspend the rules of your breakup in case “the apocalypse” keeps you apart forever, and you find yourself lying once again in his bed, your faces flushed, the afternoon humming by outside, take your time with leaving. The future will charge onward, but for now you can allow the memory of other lazy days you spent in this bed to envelop you entirely. You would like to believe this feeling transcends whatever comes next. For an hour or two, it does. — Lily Goldberg",Lily Goldberg
232,2020-03-24T19:00:10+0000,"Going All Out, All the Time","From the beginning, I was awed by how big and bold Sam’s voice was, his energy and stature too. At weddings, he danced so hard he would sweat through his suit and sometimes split his pants. That’s my date, I thought. (Still do.) In the middle of our story now — married with two sweet sons who look like him — I continue to admire how Sam lives on a different scale, with an inability to whisper, sip, eat only half a sandwich or love us halfway. — Amy Klimoski",Amy Klimoski
233,2020-03-24T19:00:10+0000,Alone in a Retirement Home,"My 88-year-old mother is no longer able to walk or do much else by herself, effectively stuck in her retirement home. Most of the facility’s residents are women: mothers and a handful of Blitz survivors, like my mother. They watch the news alone in their rooms or in the common area. They know what is happening “outside.” My mother realizes that she is among the most vulnerable. Yet while speaking over the phone (I’m in America; she’s in Canada), my mother worries not about herself falling ill, but me, her “poor love.” — Alexander Wooley",Alexander Wooley
234,2020-03-24T19:00:10+0000,The Treasures He Will Leave Behind,"For one week in 40 of his springs, my father searched the shore for shells. My sister tried to keep up; my brother drew in the sand with sticks. I followed behind, collecting the broken shells my father tossed aside. Now, we guide our father’s hands over his old treasures. I read shell names aloud: pear whelk, leafy jewel box, ponderous ark. Suffering from Parkinson’s and dementia, my father simply listens, closes his eyes and smiles. Soon, my siblings and I will search the shore once more, desperate to find what the sea and my father have left behind. — Carrie Friedman",Carrie Friedman
235,2020-03-17T20:23:59+0000,Two Pairs of Hands,"You, age 47, marry a man, age 65. There is no gap in your mental or motor skills. Then one day you are 62. He is 80. Over morning coffee, he says, “I need to write a thank-you note to Paul.” You reply, “Uh-huh. Do that.” He does not respond. You look up from your laptop. His eyes are misty. “I can’t write. That damn shake.” His doctor says the hand tremor is benign. Just old age. So here it is, writ large: age gap. You say, “I’ll write it for you.” He reaches over, grasps your hand. — Holly Mullen",Holly Mullen
236,2020-03-17T20:23:59+0000,Identical in Every Way,"Four years ago, I gave birth to my first child, a son. My identical twin sister, Julie, was in the room. Julie and I have been bonded since birth: Our father is from an area in Nigeria that has one of the highest rates of twin births in the world. My sister’s middle name, Taiwo, means firstborn twin in Yoruba, and mine, Kehinde, means second-born twin. My son’s birth signified our first unshared experience. That is, until Julie gave birth to her own first child, also a son, as I watched in the delivery room, instantly reuniting our twin bond. — Jessica Kehinde Ngo",Jessica Kehinde Ngo
237,2020-03-17T20:23:59+0000,My Three Broken Hearts,"My first broken heart came from a girl I met at church, our hidden relationship complicated by inexperience, religion and uncertain sexuality. The second? A woman whose whispers — “I love you,” “I can’t do this anymore” — emphasized the 13 years that separated us. The third? The moment my service as an Army officer felt inconsequential. Surrounded by compromised leadership, I watched the dream that began when I was 6 disappear. But like a good soldier, I will pick up that broken heart, tie it with 550 cord and carry on. — Dina Kim",Dina Kim
238,2020-03-17T20:23:59+0000,A Summary of Love,"Fat girl in school. Judged for the outside. Hardened by jabs but always wanting to be loved. Lost weight in college, exercised, became “normal.” Wrestled the fat-girl trauma away. But still no dates, no love, no hope? Worked, focused on career and graduate school. Dated without success. Gave up, hung with friends. Got close to one guy, talked long hours, shared puns. But he was an exchange student, gone after one semester. So we wrote letters every day. Connection grew. Visited him in Sweden where we finally named it love. Decades later, I see it was worth the wait. — Dawn Leijon",Dawn Leijon
239,2020-03-10T19:00:12+0000,The Wild Ones,"When we met, we were the wild ones. We recognized it in each other. Our nights roaming Los Angeles continued as we pursued our own career paths. Then, our first house, our first baby. I thought I would die from missing our wildness. Our second baby turned us into business partners, essentially, with our communication limited to exchanging information about the children, schedules, bills. Life accelerated; we were stressed and breathless. Until we decided to change everything, to move to the countryside, focus on our children, exist with the awareness that life is a finite gift. What a wild idea. — Maria Coltharp",Maria Coltharp
240,2020-03-10T19:00:12+0000,Frugal Kindness,"“The sink is leaking,” I told my 77-year-old landlady. She came up to my Parisian attic apartment with a 16-inch wrench. We tightened nuts at random, playing plumber. “Go buy some tape and wrap everything,” she said. “I’m very economical; during World War II we had nothing!” Frustrated by our haphazard method, I fumed in the sink’s wet underbelly. But then I remembered the homemade cookies on my counter. This same frugality underpinned my landlady’s generosity. “I love you very much,” she said the day she gave me those cookies. “I love you too,” I said. — Matthew Barrett",— Matthew Barrett
241,2020-03-10T19:00:12+0000,A Cowboy in God’s House,"Fifty years ago, my family and I lived in California’s cattle country. When my son was 3, we would visit a small church that I called God’s house. As my son and I were leaving the church one day, we passed by a well-dressed cowboy climbing the stairs. My son stopped in his tracks and said, “Hi, God!” The man looked at me then said, “Hi, son.” He walked into the church and we went home. Since that act of kindness, I visualize a tall, gentle cowboy when I pray. I always say, “Hi, God!” — Teresa Rogers",Teresa Rogers
242,2020-03-10T19:00:12+0000,‘Old Never Happened for Him’,"Randy was a good Jewish boy; I, a shiksa. Nevertheless, we dated in college, happy until the Vietnam War intervened. He served while I went from Sorority Sue to protesting hippie. Time passed, we moved on. The month of my wedding, Randy called, asking me not to go through with it. That night I got very drunk. The wedding happened, life progressed, my husband died. In my heart, I knew Randy and I would end up together when we were old. Old never happened for him. I still see him in my dreams. — Kathryn Jarvis",Kathryn Jarvis
243,2020-03-03T20:00:08+0000,What Love Feels Like,"We were lying on the shaggy carpet of my 500-square-foot apartment, playing Bananagrams, deciding what love feels like. I said, “It’s the workout where you squat and catch the medicine ball at the same time. It’s falling and lifting at once.” Paul said, “How heavy is the ball?” I thought about it — about his depression and compulsiveness, my type-A personality and body-image issues. Just because we are in love doesn’t mean things have been easy. I replied, “I mean, how do you think I got thighs like these?” — E.J. Schwartz",E.J. Schwartz
244,2020-03-03T20:00:08+0000,Listen to Your Mother,"Under the guise of being a dutiful — not heartbroken — son, I called my mother on the second anniversary of my father’s death. “Michael, I’m not going to be one of those widows complaining about how tough life is,” she said. “I got out of bed, went to the gym and had lunch with friends. Your dad would have been disappointed if I didn’t. None of this ‘poor me.’” Turns out I needed that call more than she. My regret for being unable to visit my father a final time faded. My mother is right: Life is for living. — Michael Pointer",Michael Pointer
245,2020-03-03T20:00:08+0000,The Vanishing Magician,"I was smitten with the magician. Unexpectedly alone at his show, I volunteered to be his audience participant. Onstage, he asked me to write an everyday object on a piece of paper. I wrote “electric toothbrush” and sealed the envelope. “Does it vibrate?” he said, smiling, flirting, apparently reading my mind. We went on a few dates, then he sent me an email to break it off. Gmail suggested some responses: “I understand,” “I agree with you” and “No worries.” I wish he had dumped me via magic instead. He could have just disappeared. — Jenny Gorelick",Jenny Gorelick
246,2020-03-03T20:00:08+0000,Late-Night Ultimatum,"I was supposed to help my parents move in the morning, but Ailene chose that night, at 1 a.m., for her ultimatum: We would either leave my car as a couple or never see each other again. I loved Ailene. She loved me. Yet, my being trans had, to that point, complicated my relationships. (My mother, incredulous and inquisitive, had once asked, “Does this mean you’re a lesbian?”) I would receive my first hormone injection the following week. Who could love someone like me? I knew who. It was 4 a.m. when we left my car as a couple. — Amber Meyer",Amber Meyer
247,2020-02-25T20:34:27+0000,A Safe Haven in Bed,"I left Pittsburgh and Michael left Brooklyn for the dreamy, woodsy school we had only heard good things about. We did not realize that those things would be permitted only to me, with my white skin. For Michael, school was a constant terror. A few nights after we met, Michael abandoned his room for mine to escape his school-assigned roommate, who encouraged other students to shout racial slurs and pound on his dormitory door. That first night, we held each other tight, fearful of falling out of the twin bed we were forced to share. We haven’t slept apart since. — Eimile McKinnon",Eimile McKinnon
248,2020-02-25T20:34:27+0000,Most of Our Years Were Good Ones,"Stuck in a box in a closet, the hat my ex-husband gave me was now just an extravagant thing owned by a non-extravagant woman. I asked furriers for help, but they said the hat could only be what it was. Not a headband. Not a collar. “Most women would kill for this,” said one. “Put it on and strut,” said another. But I didn’t want a trophy hat. I just wanted a small memento in the cold, reminding me that most of our years had been good ones, a time when he had warmed my winters and I had warmed his. — Marsha Jacobson",Marsha Jacobson
249,2020-02-25T20:34:27+0000,"‘Mommy, I Am You’","On a lazy Sunday, Olivia disappears from the living room, later returning “dressed as Mommy.” She wears my red dress, green flats and crossbody bag. I don’t need to go upstairs to know what my bedroom looks like. I suppress a smile and get ready to tell her off. But then she gives me that look — that unmatched, adoring look — and says matter-of-factly, “Mommy, I am you.” I look at this loving little girl, who sees the version of me I can never be. Soon enough she will be grown up. Until then, let us enjoy this moment. — Sophia Nikoleishvili",Am
250,2020-02-25T20:34:27+0000,Please Wear That Dress,"Both young poets, we met on the set of “The United States of Poetry,” a documentary Bob Holman produced and I participated in. I recited my poems in a striped, blue-and-white dress. Twenty-five years later, Bob is widowed and I’m divorced. He contacts me online, asking me to meet and, please, to wear the dress. That dress is long-gone, but when we reunite I am reminded of the stripes in Bob’s blue eyes. We kiss in a taxi and I feel love. When we pull back, I see him seeing me in that dress of my youth. — Thylias Moss",Thylias Moss
251,2020-02-18T20:00:08+0000,"‘Where to Live, How to Live, Why to Live?’","Newly paraplegic at the age of 23, I needed answers. Where to live, how to live, why to live? One afternoon a colleague (and secret crush) visited me at the rehabilitation center. He took me on my first, terrifying foray into the real world down 34th Street in Manhattan. I told him I wanted to return when I couldn’t bear the stares of passers-by any longer. He said, “They are staring at you because they’ve never seen a woman so beautiful.” Tongue-tied, I looked up at him and saw love looking back. It was the only answer I needed. — Lauren Furst",Lauren Furst
252,2020-02-18T20:00:08+0000,"Somehow, She Knew","We were sitting in my grandmother’s living room. She was showing me an old photo album. One of the photos was of my parents, young and happy. She paused, smiled, squeezed my hand, then whispered in Greek, “I hope that you find someone with a good heart.” Two years earlier, she would tell me that she had hoped I would find “a nice Greek boy.” She was the only family member I hadn’t told I was gay. Something tells me I won’t need to. — Caitlin Turner",Caitlin Turner
253,2020-02-18T20:00:08+0000,Sure Will Miss That Venmo,"A $5 charge for a lox and cream cheese on pumpernickel, toasted. A 2-cent bribe for attention from across the room. A chicken emoji for half of the Popeyes we had ordered at 3 a.m. A $12 request for pad thai that I ate before falling asleep in front of the TV, his hand on my waist. When we said goodbye in a tiny New York City noodle shack, I cried, knowing that we were never going to Venmo the same $15 again. — Jessica Hu",Jessica Hu
254,2020-02-18T20:00:08+0000,The Sun Didn’t Rush Us,"I rose one morning while Elvie was still asleep. Knowing she was tired, I did not want to wake her. She stirred and told me to raise the blinds, then come back to bed and “cuddle” her. The sun streamed gently through the window. I thought I heard it whisper, “Don’t hurry, I’ll be up all day.” I went back to bed and cuddled her as she wished. We remained still for a few more minutes, listening to each other, breathing. — Jon Melegrito",Jon Melegrito
255,2020-02-11T20:00:09+0000,My Polygamist Ancestor and Me,"My middle name is Traugott, after my only polygamist ancestor. At 36, I came out as gay, divorced my wife and left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. At 37, I began dating a man. At 42, we married. A year later, we’ve entered the stormy landscape of polyamory. We have each other, our children and boyfriends. I never thought I would have anything more in common with Traugott than an odd name. Now, I wonder: Could he and his two wives have given me relevant advice, a map for my new love life? Oh, sweet Jesus, the irony. — Shawn Bitters",Shawn Bitters
256,2020-02-11T20:00:09+0000,A Bookmark Near the End,"He loves history. He wanted to write a biography of John Quincy Adams. I, shamefully, knew almost nothing about John Quincy Adams, so I went online and bought every biography of him I could find. One day, he called me, claiming that we wouldn’t work out long term. He said he loved me but that we had different interests. “What does love mean to you?” I said. “That’s an impossible question,” he replied. I, however, find love to be quite simple. Love is the stack of biographies on my nightstand with a bookmark near the end. — Julia Nicole Camp",Julia Nicole Camp
257,2020-02-11T20:00:09+0000,"Loving Each Other, Hard","We broke his bed. It’s exactly as it sounds. Every time we made love after the break, the frame would groan and wheeze in tandem, as if echoing our efforts. My boyfriend and I have both moved homes, cycling through cheap furniture as we have the phases of our lives. I sometimes mourn the loss of that squeaky bed frame and all it represented. We love each other, hard. — Maggie Mahoney",Maggie Mahoney
258,2020-02-11T20:00:09+0000,Cannabis Cookies for Oscar,"Fourteen years ago, Oscar ran with me down to the tide pools, scrambling over rocks and chasing crabs into their hiding places. He chased all of his dreams back then — UPS trucks, skateboards, cats. He ran for miles on those four little legs. Now, my mother brushes his teeth and feeds him cannabis cookies every night. “Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, is it?” she says to him, and he looks up at her like he knows exactly what she means. — Sophie Newman",Sophie Newman
259,2020-02-04T20:00:09+0000,Our Ages Added Up Perfectly,"In 1990, I joined Herb’s campaign for South Carolina governor. Herb wanted to overturn the provision in the state constitution that prohibited atheists from holding public office. We met in person, then fell in love via phone and letter during the summer. I worried about telling him my age. When he asked, I said, “Fifty-two. And you?” “Forty-eight.” We lost the election but helped to overturn the law. After we wed, I asked, “What did you think when I told you my age?” He said, “I thought 52 and 48 make 100.” Did I mention he was a mathematics professor? — Sharon Fratepietro",Sharon Fratepietro
260,2020-02-04T20:00:09+0000,The Silent Treatment,"“Shut Up!” my 7-year-old son said to me. Stunned silence. A single mother, I knew it was decision time. We don’t talk to each other like that. So shut up I did. For three days I would not speak to him or answer his questions. He begged me to say something as I performed our daily rituals. I was hurt and determined, though unsure of the outcome. On my pillow, day four, lay a note: “Dear mum, I miss the sound of your lovely voice, and I am truly sorry.” Tears. Hugs. He never said “shut up” to me again. — Diana Henry",Diana Henry
261,2020-02-04T20:00:09+0000,Toast Will Bring Us Together,"It was an awkward first date between me, a foreigner from the United States, and Yun-Hsing, a Taiwanese. I took her to a party with too much English and not enough privacy. Friends kept interrupting to ask about my latest heartbreak, my missing cat, Toast. Trying to salvage the night, I invited her back to my place. I was changing clothes when I heard her shouting. When I ran over, she was holding Toast! We spontaneously embraced, melting our awkwardness. That was three years ago. We married this summer after Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage. — Hannah Chang",Hannah Chang
262,2020-02-04T20:00:09+0000,Less Lovable Than Lobster,"Despite a drawn-out divorce, I frequently have reveries about a certain endearing trait of my former wife. When half-asleep, she would often make funny statements in her altered state. Example No. 1: She: “Turn off the light.” Me: “I did.” She: “No.” She points to the window. Me: “That’s the moon.” She: “Then turn off the moon.” Example No. 2, my favorite: As she snuggled up to me, eyes closed and semiconscious, she murmured, “I love you more than anything.” A pause. “Except lobster.” — Gene Keyes",Gene Keyes
263,2020-01-28T20:00:10+0000,A Shaft of Light,"We were 7-year-olds without siblings, living in adjacent Montreal apartments that shared a bathroom light shaft. Margaret had curly, ruddy-brown hair and glasses, and we simply liked each other. As soon as our parentally approved time together ended, we would run to our respective bathrooms, stand on our respective toilet seats and chatter through the windows until called away. Eventually, her family moved out and mine left Canada. Sixty-two years later, I see: That light shaft was our social medium, those windows our screens, in our analog love story. — Dov Midalia",Dov Midalia
264,2020-01-28T20:00:10+0000,Before Tinder and Grindr,"His shirtless picture caught my eye. “Me on my solo pilgrimage to Israel,” Todd typed. “Sorry if it’s risqué.” He’s cute, I thought. I was Catholic but drawn to this modest yet adventurous Jewish man. I had tried blind dates, New York City gay bars, even personal ads. In 2000, AOL chat rooms were a new way of socializing. Long before Tinder and Grindr, online hookups sounded illicit. So for years we lied to friends and family about how we met. Two decades and two children later, we’re proud that he, “HeartofBklyn,” found a connection with me, “GymRat.” — Steve Majors",Steve Majors
265,2020-01-28T20:00:10+0000,The Youngest Legal Scholar,"Without family near or money to spare, I brought my newborn with me to law school, placing her on my lap during class. Jane’s presence may have distracted other students, but it also brought them joy. (Without a dose of humanity, civil procedure can be rather dry.) Jane never cried — neither in class nor as I wrote papers late into the night, waiting for my medical resident husband to come home. Now, my daughter thinks my lawyer job is boring, but her quiet patience made it all possible. — Kate Vaughan",Kate Vaughan
266,2020-01-28T20:00:10+0000,When Bonds Don’t Break,"Marrying Pankaj wasn’t easy. We both lived in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand but belonged to different castes. Despite our parents’ opposition, we married. Eleven years into our marriage, I got terribly sick with dengue fever. As my weight dropped and my organs failed, I felt defeated, unable to fight further. Then, in the midst of my exhausted, blurred consciousness, I heard Pankaj’s voice: “Listen, you’re not going anywhere. I’m not letting you go. Do you get it?” I blinked and lived on. — Shikha Tiwari",Shikha Tiwari

I feel good.” And he said, “I’m happy.” And I said, “I’m happy.” And he said, “I like this.” And I said, “I like you.” That was it — not in a “that was it, they fell in love” kind of way, but in a “that was it, he saw the possibility of connection beyond the confines of my bed and got scared and ran away” type of way. — Sarah Marlin",Sarah Marlin
268,2020-01-21T19:00:08+0000,"Her Father, the Computer","My husband, Hideki, was transferred to New Jersey from Tokyo. He left me and our 19-month-old toddler, Akari, to wrap things up. During our three-month separation, we video chatted. For Akari, her father existed in my computer. When Hideki returned to bring us to America, Akari saw him in our doorway and froze, hiding behind me and staring: first at my computer, then at him. Computer, him. Back and forth. Finally, she smiled and waddled to him for a hug. My anxiety about our new life melted away. — Ayumi Tagawa",Ayumi Tagawa
269,2020-01-21T19:00:08+0000,Double Cousins,"Carolyn was born a year after me in the same month, April. Our mothers were sisters and our fathers were brothers, making us double cousins. As children in a Pennsylvania farming community, we often wore matching dresses, our hair in identical pixie cuts. After high school our paths diverged: me to college, eventually across the country; Carolyn to marriage at 19, two children, and a life devoted to church and family. When we met every few years, we hid our disappointment in each other’s choices. In middle age, dual breast cancer diagnoses brought us together again, no longer judging, rejoined. — Kathy Miller",Kathy Miller
270,2020-01-21T19:00:08+0000,"O.K., Never Mind","My 93-year-old grandmother, who suffered from dementia, would call me by my brother’s name: “Azim!

271,2020-01-14T19:05:14+0000,"Why Marry? Oh, Right, That’s Why","David was washing dishes after supper, his back to me, when we decided to get married. Throughout our 17 years together I had resisted the idea, not wanting to surrender authority to the church or to the state, both of which had opposed our marriage for centuries. Once more, I asked David why he wanted to wed. “Because it would bring me joy,” he replied, and that settled that. — David Jenkins",David Jenkins

Everyone eats while seated on the floor; no one is higher or lower than his or her neighbor. I watch in awe as my grandmother, Kulwant Kaur, kneads a mound of dough. When the naan is done, a teenage boy picks up a perfectly cooked piece, bows his head in gratitude and embraces my grandmother. In a socially divided world, food unifies. — Henna Hundal",Henna Hundal

Together ever since we awoke the next morning. — Robert Topper",Robert Topper
274,2020-01-14T19:05:14+0000,Wearing Her Eye Shadow,"My best friend’s husband said he had something for me, then handed over a bag of Ilyse’s makeup. Eye shadow had broken open, pinkish-purple dust coating the contents. He said, “Damn it, I should’ve been more careful with it. I hope there’s something you can use.” It took him three years after she died to part with this. He doesn’t know that makeup expires, or that people shouldn’t wear each other’s. Later, my husband said, “Throw that away.” I did, but the next day, while alone, I fished the bag from the garbage. Ilyse’s eyeliner is my shade. I’m wearing it now. — Suzanne Roberts",Suzanne Roberts

Recipes and measurements are nonexistent, but his food is always delicious. When Dominic cooks, the counters are spotless and the dishes clean. “Wash while you’re cooking,” he says. His hands are mysteriously baby-skin soft in spite of all the scrubbing. Dominic hasn’t told me that he loves me, unprompted, in days. But then he’ll look at me as I eat his food, our children sitting beside us. “Te quiero tanto” (“I love you very much”) is what I taste. — Susana Odriozola",Susana Odriozola
276,2020-01-07T19:00:09+0000,What We Do In the End,"“Your sister is in the hospital,” my mother said over the phone. “You need to come home.” I had no idea that Jenny, a 44-year-old suburban mother, would be dead from prescription opioids just six days later. Although blindsided by her fatal addiction, I was grateful for those final days in the hospital: feeding my sister, shuffling her to the bathroom, singing show tunes (her eyes always closed) and telling her I loved her. That’s what we do in the end: the messy, tender, heartbreaking things. We are our best selves, even if it’s too late. — Kelly O’Connor",Kelly O’Connor
277,2020-01-07T19:00:09+0000,Making Friends Over 40,"I never see my old friends anymore. Neither does my wife. The extended punk-rock “family” of our youth is long gone. We’ve all drifted apart physically and emotionally. Our jobs changed. Our responsibilities changed. We changed. Making friends over 40 is hard. There isn’t much to bond over. The new connections we do form are tenuous, easily disrupted by the slightest inconvenience. Are relationships transactional? Do we simply have little left to offer? My wife and I feel alone, but at least are alone together. We cling to each other more tightly each year, hoping the other is enough. — Daniel Lee Perea",Daniel Lee Perea
278,2020-01-07T19:00:09+0000,My Scrawny Little Brother is My Protector,"I’m 12 years old and sleep on a 6-foot bed. My bed is perfectly comfortable, but I have trouble sleeping. Nothing changes my terror of the night and its darkness — the darkness that crawls into dreams, turning them into nightmares. A few months ago, I asked my 8-year-old brother to sleep with me. Who knew this scrawny little kid could make such a change in my life? He helps me feel safe, helps me feel strong. He helps me sleep through those otherwise sleepless nights. — Vivaan Parikh",Vivaan Parikh
279,2019-12-31T15:00:10+0000,The Flamingo Connection,"Peyton posted a picture with his flamingo, Lisa, wearing a Santa hat. Lisa had an Instagram account, so I followed it. He texted: “I see you following my lawn flamingo on Instagram.” I replied: “You tagged it in a photo. What other option did I have?” The texts got longer. Christmas slid to New Year’s and eventually to an evening watching the stars. I asked him why he texted me; he asked why I responded. We both knew. I’m thankful for that flamingo. “She’s the only girl I’ll ever love,” he once said. But that’s not true anymore. — Kate Bellows",Kate Bellows
280,2019-12-31T15:00:10+0000,Hash-Brown Hanukkah Hack,"After reading about the Hanukkah hack online, I bought four bags of frozen hash browns. As we fried them up, our house smelled like onions and potatoes and Hanukkah. Not one of our 14 guests knew there had been no arduous grating. But my sister-in-law was suspicious. She looked at my husband’s hands and noted the lack of cuts. “How’d you do it?” she said. He smiled. “I’m a good grater.” I thought about blowing his cover. Everybody wanted seconds. She said, “Come on, dude.” He winked at me. I didn’t say a word. — Robin Finn",Robin Finn
281,2019-12-31T15:00:10+0000,A Space in the Storm,"Despite an impending New Year’s blizzard, I drove my little Honda to the Hamptons to visit a friend. We got cabin fever, both wanting to be somewhere else for the holiday, and drove back to the city before they closed the roads. We passed cars stuck like Lego pieces in the snow and made it home. The lots were full. My traveling companion left me to go ring in the new year, so I called my friend, John, who appeared with a smile and a shovel. In clearing a spot for my car, he created a space where I felt loved. — Elana Rabinowitz",Elana Rabinowitz
282,2019-12-31T15:00:10+0000,Dusty Pink New Year,"My 65-year-old mother entered the hospital on Dec. 21; her liver was past its expiration date. With my father buried the year before and my sister stationed in Germany, the holidays evaporated. After midnight on Christmas Eve, I arrived home from my bedside vigil to discover a red box cradling a dusty pink silk shirt — my size, my shade. My high school classmate’s Jewish mother, no stranger to loss, had refused to let my Christmas be ghosted. I wore the blouse to the funeral, wore it until the sleeves shredded. Dusty pink is my New Year’s color. — Susie Case",Susie Case
283,2019-12-24T12:00:08+0000,Love Is the Way My Friends Laugh,"I spent the last night of Hanukkah knee-deep in potato peelings with my closest friends. None of them are Jewish, but they were all eager. We ate latkes, passed the Shamash around my dining room table so we could each light a candle on the menorah. Watching my friends take such care with a religion that is not their own evoked an unexpected tenderness. Love is the way my friends laughed as we stood around my kitchen island on my last Hanukkah at home before college, squeezing grated potatoes into patties and sliding them into oiled pans. — Rachel Lynch",Rachel Lynch
284,2019-12-24T12:00:08+0000,He Waited Until Morning,"It was Christmas Eve in the intensive care unit. My husband was unresponsive. I put my head on his bed and dozed off. When I awoke, it was 2 a.m. Christmas morning. Death was coming and I was afraid. I caressed his hand and talked to him. “I don’t want to drive home alone in the dark and cold. Can you wait until dawn to pass on?” I got in bed with him, our souls met. Peace. The sun came up and my husband took his last breath. His final gift to me was the gift of light. — Cathy Lickteig Makofski",Cathy Lickteig Makofski
285,2019-12-24T12:00:08+0000,The Object of No Significance,"Our first Christmas as a couple, we were living on opposite coasts. He was a self-described clueless gift giver. With apology, he handed me a glass-blown ornament in the shape of a Hershey’s kiss, calling it “The Object of Great Significance.” Whenever I felt despondent about the distance, he said to imagine the space within the ornament’s swirly iridescent walls as somewhere we were always together. He looked sheepish; I cried. The next Christmas, he moved home and gave me a stuffed Hershey’s kiss toy, calling it “The Object of No Significance.” We no longer had to imagine. — Diane Cheng",Diane Cheng
286,2019-12-24T12:00:08+0000,Trusting the Edge,"A family holiday card that year would have shown our faces being scratched out: father dead, mother in assisted living, one brother in a coma. I’d just broken up with a dishonest, possibly-cheating-on-me-boyfriend. My brother Gary took me ice-skating at the local rink. He was graceful and fluid; I tottered on wobbly ankles. He skated over with ibuprofen, a Walkman and headphones. Coltrane was playing “My Favorite Things.” “Trust the edge,” Gary said. Soon I was gliding along, no longer depressed or caring if I fell. I knew he would be there to help me up. — Kim Addonizio",Kim Addonizio
287,2019-12-17T19:00:09+0000,Linked by a Stranger From Brooklyn,"I’m a geneticist. At a conference where I was presenting, I spit into a tube for one of those DNA tests that are now all the craze. How fitting but surprising to discover not one but six half-siblings. I grew up with one full sister. Our parents, now deceased, never mentioned a sperm donor. I suppose that’s how they quietly managed infertility in the 1950s. Although I was initially incredulous, I delight in the fact that, more than half a century ago, an anonymous man from Brooklyn gave us the gift of life and, years later, each other. — Ricki Lewis",Ricki Lewis
288,2019-12-17T19:00:09+0000,Suddenly Happy,"My husband, two young daughters and I were a close and happy family. One July 4, my husband suffered heart complications and eventually died. It was a bleak and traumatic time for us. I operated on autopilot, managing my daily tasks robotically. With little hope in her voice, my youngest daughter asked, “Mom, will we ever be happy again?” I looked at her and promised, “We will be happy again.” My words were really a prayer. Years passed. One day while driving in our new car my youngest suddenly declared, “Mom, you promised we’d be happy again, and we are.” — Lois Cooper",Lois Cooper
289,2019-12-17T19:00:09+0000,There’s a Logic to Love,"As an engineer, I believe problems have logical solutions. To solve my relationship problem, I needed to structure it. Standing at my boyfriend’s whiteboard with a marker and a flowchart I’d drawn, I asked him questions, tracing his answers down the chart. He was happy but wasn’t sure he could fall in love with me. The chart said “Break up,” so we did. I went back to him, promising to love myself enough for both of us. It didn’t work. We broke up again. Love is simple. The flowchart and your heart must lead to the same answer: “Stay.” — Jack Simmons",Jack Simmons
290,2019-12-17T19:00:09+0000,Into the Snow for Chocolate,"It was a snowy New York City winter. My husband, dog and I were living in a fourth-floor walk-up on East 84th Street. I woke up one night at 2 a.m. with an intense craving for chocolate. I woke my husband, Vic, asking him if we had any chocolate, though I knew we didn’t. He looked at me, said nothing, got out of bed, put on his snow gear and left. A half-hour later he returned, silently handing me a large box filled with M&M’s and Chunky bars. Without a word, he went back to sleep. That’s love. — Ruth Ress",Ruth Ress
291,2019-12-10T19:00:10+0000,When a Chandelier Falls on Your Head,"All I ever wanted was a dog, but Carlito was allergic and unmovable. I married him anyway, certain that love would prevail. One night while eating with friends in a Manhattan restaurant, a 50-pound chandelier broke out of the ceiling, partly striking my head. I bled; he wept. When the E.M.T. told everyone I would live, Carlito’s friend leaned over my stretcher and whispered, “Now’s the time to ask for anything …” We named the puppy Chandelier. Carlito sneezed every day of our dog’s life, but he didn’t care one bit. — Shari Simpson",Shari Simpson
292,2019-12-10T19:00:10+0000,I Didn’t Run,"I met David on a blind date. The next day, I invited him over for tea. He appeared on my porch, peeking through the glass, offering me his cupped palms. “It’s all yours,” he said. “What? Sweaty hands?” “No.” He beamed. “My heart.” Typically, this would make me run, but I didn’t. He had picked me to hold his heart. His body was ravaged with cancer, but still, I accepted. We laughed. We cried. We married. Twenty-two months after our eyes met, I stood at the river, cupping my palms with ashes, and let go. — Susan Purvis",Susan Purvis
293,2019-12-10T19:00:10+0000,She Stretched Like My Cat,"Wendy was one of my favorite single-mum friends. She had a disconcertingly careless way of stretching that reminded me of my cat. Her stomach was toned and her T-shirts were tight. One day, she turned up at a friend’s house with a girlfriend. I was so cross that I started avoiding her. She assumed I was homophobic. I missed her optimism and her endless enthusiasm for gossip and chocolate. Eventually, I tossed a coin and invited her over for a drink. I was terrified. We got married last year. Turns out, all that stretching hadn’t been so careless after all. — Joanna Lambert",Joanna Lambert

Single, 31, living with my mother and even clubbing together, I was surfing the unique freedom that comes with having nothing left to lose. It was the highest low. I was sad and thrilled. Figuratively and literally dancing as if no one was watching. I thought I saw someone watching, though. Now, a few months later, I’m moving in with him. — Maria-Cristina Trepcea",Maria-Cristina Trepcea
296,2019-12-03T19:00:05+0000,She Laughed Big,"She lived for 56 years, 26 of them with me. She died. I live. No one in the world laughed like she did: big, loud, head turning. Easy to remember. What a blessing. — Elizabeth Hutchins",Elizabeth Hutchins
297,2019-12-03T19:00:05+0000,I Miss That Too-Small Bed,"The antique hotel bed that my wife and I shared to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary wasn’t designed for a 6-foot-3 individual like me. Measuring 6 by 6 feet and boasting an oversize footboard, the bed made it impossible for me to stretch my legs. Yet after 48 years together, those cramped quarters beckon. Was it the cheap Champagne, the laughter or the scrunched lovemaking that make that night so vivid? We were so fit, so young, so beautiful. At 68, I miss this younger version of us and the time we shared in that decrepit, too-small bed. — Al Miles",Al Miles
298,2019-12-03T19:00:05+0000,An Opening in the Fence,"The day we buried our father, the eccentric neighbor who had terrified us as children appeared at our mother’s door. He grunted condolences with a shake of his head: “A good man, a bloody good man.” As our mother’s billowing grief subsided over the years, we noticed that a section of the fence between her yard and his had disappeared. A path developed. For two decades, that path mapped the unlikeliest of friendships and led to a quiet, unexpected love. Our neighbor won’t walk that path again. Our mother grieves for another bloody good man. — Kate Murphy",Kate Murphy
299,2019-11-26T18:51:15+0000,Six Pies. One Acrylic Nail.,"When I remember my mother, I think of Thanksgiving: a sweltering kitchen, flour coated counters, piercing laughter through coffee-stained teeth and pies galore. I think of one year when — after hours of work involving every fruit imaginable — my mother noticed she had lost a chipped acrylic nail. It must be in a pie, we surmised. “Should we still serve them?” I asked nervously. “We could … ” my mother said. She’s gone now, but when I remember her, I think of the woman who threw away six tasty pies and baked six more — this time, wearing gloves. — Emily Varga",Emily Varga
300,2019-11-26T18:51:15+0000,Don’t Blame This on Mercury,"We were sitting on his memory-foam mattress when he admitted to being a bad boyfriend. “The moon is pulling different elements of my sign,” he said. “It’s mercury in retrograde,” he said. A feeling of dread crept into my throat and held it closed. I wondered why the moon had never pulled me away from him. I looked up and saw a shiny ripped condom wrapper on his nightstand. It wasn’t ours. Was it a sign? I silently got up and left because I had my own two feet and nothing in the universe could stop me. — Laurel Kho",Laurel Kho
301,2019-11-26T18:51:15+0000,Giving Thanks,"The day before Thanksgiving, snow was on the ground. Opening my downstairs door, I heard a painful cry. A young calico cat with a bleeding paw looked up. What to do? I’d spent my life helping stray animals. But my boyfriend would get angry if I brought her home, putting our four cats at risk. Hating myself, I closed the door and climbed the stairs. A while later, my boyfriend unlocked our door, calling out that we had a problem. He had rescued the cat I had turned away. I knew I’d chosen the right man. We named her Esmeralda. — Susan Patterson",Susan Patterson
302,2019-11-26T18:51:15+0000,This Is How Your Life Changes,"She was on top of me in the 3 a.m. darkness. I held her in my arms. She was staring down at me. “Do you love me?” I said. “Yes.” “How much?” “Much, too much.” I looked up at her, at her burning eyes and blonde hair, wild and silhouetted against the muted whiteness of the ceiling. “Me too,” I said. Beginning an affair, I knew I was at the edge, right at the very edge. What the hell, I thought, and I let myself go across. At that moment, I knew my life would never be the same. — Richard Gross",Richard Gross

The ford was submerged, but you drove onto it and opened your door. Water rushed beneath the car. “Open yours,” you said. I sat, frozen. You laughed. I opened the door an inch, then more. “Now listen.” The sound of the creek filled the car. I breathed in wet grass, mud, dead leaves. I reached down and let the water run through my fingertips. Life with you, I knew, would be different. — Jessica Braun",Jessica Braun
304,2019-11-19T19:30:08+0000,Something to Give,"The last time I saw my grandma, she had no idea who I was. She’d lost everything: her memories, her laugh, her weight. She’d shiver, constantly. “Cold,” she’d whisper. “Cold.” I kept trying to give her a blanket, but she’d panic every time and hand it back to me. We repeated this until, finally, she used all her energy to reach out and wrap the blanket around me. For the first time, she relaxed, smiled — perfectly content as she shivered. Even with everything taken from her, she found something to give. — Julia Camp",Julia Camp
305,2019-11-19T19:30:08+0000,It Could Have Been a Romantic Tragedy,"The movie wasn’t a romantic tragedy, but the date almost was. Jane looked up and smiled as I slid past her, with a tub of popcorn in one hand and a soda in the other. I slipped, dropping all of the popcorn on her head. Everyone in the theater gasped. Time seemed to stop. I was at a loss for words. I blurted out, “Would you like some soda with our popcorn?” She stared up slack-jawed, then burst out laughing. It was then that our story changed from romantic tragedy to romantic comedy. — Marty Hafner",Marty Hafner
306,2019-11-19T19:30:08+0000,It’s O.K. to Feel Fear,"My daughter couldn’t fall asleep because she was scared. Nothing helped — not the backrub or child valerian drops or my assurance of no monsters. She spiraled into hiccuping sobs. I pleaded, “Honey, everyone’s scared of something.” “No! You’re not scared of anything.” “I am!” “What are you scared of?” I tried to think of some comforting half-truth. “See? You’re not scared of anything!” “I am,” I whispered. “I’m scared … of getting old … and my anger. And consumerism, stupidity, children without attention spans, distracted drivers and — ” “O.K., have good dreams, Mama.” She turned and fell asleep. — Karen Rizzo",Karen Rizzo

For five Wednesday nights, my friend and I were buzzed into the local middle school, where we sat at small desks among other newly single parents: the crying blonde in scrubs, the angry landscaper, the excited executive. I brought gin in an orange Nalgene bottle. He hadn’t eaten for days. On the night I saw my son’s geography project propped up on the classroom radiator, we kissed behind the clothing donation bin, and I thought I would die of grief and hope. — Bethany Dorau",Bethany Dorau

I’d say the names of loved ones, and she would attempt to repeat them. After days of frustration, she began to correctly, proudly and loudly say the names when the photographs were produced. One day she started humming the tune of an old nursery rhyme, and I joined her in recalling the words. A nurse came to the door and asked what we were doing. My mother smiled and said, “We … are doing … love.” — Tracy Siani",Tracy Siani
309,2019-11-12T18:43:41+0000,The Prairie Dog of My Dreams,"When I was young, my dreams often featured snippets of prairie dogs; they would appear intermittently, like commercial breaks. It was strange, but that’s how my dreams played. In my 20s, I found myself talking until dawn with my roommate, Ken. One night, a silly question came up: “If you could be any animal, what would you be?” “A prairie dog,” Ken said. After that conversation, the commercial breaks went dark.

I put one on our table. A minute passed. Then she said, “Hmm, still pretty dark, isn’t it?” I nodded. She grabbed another. More time passed. I said, “Gosh, it’s still pretty dark in here, right?” She nodded, sagely. By midnight, our table had 14 candles. Then we kissed. — Daniel Caprera",Daniel Caprera
311,2019-11-05T17:00:04+0000,"“I Love You, Too”","As a child, I hated my schizophrenic mother’s too-big body. As a young woman, I starved myself, only learning to eat at 26, after my mother overdosed on her medication and died. Still, I recoiled from cameras, fearful that photos would reveal that I, too, was fat. At 38, I found a letter she’d sent me at camp: “It’s so lonely without you. I love + miss you A LOT.” I wept. That night, my fiancée, Shannon, took my picture. Studying my breasts, stomach, thighs, I saw my mother. “I love you, too,” I said, silently, as if in prayer. — Leanne Milech",Leanne Milech

We fell in love late in life, with decades of experiences under our belts: city living, careers, travel, parties, parents battling cancer.

I was searching the world in the dark with a small flashlight, lying in bed alone, smartphone in hand, thinking, “What am I doing?” I downloaded an app and began writing: “Does anyone want to talk to a trans woman?” Before Diane and I met in person, she said, “I thought maybe I’d meet a friend. I didn’t think I’d find love.” We found love. We dated. We married. I transitioned to live as my true self, and we started a new life in the light. — Gia Sanchez",Gia Sanchez

I balked at the weight the trainer asked me to pull, push, carry, grab, move. “You’re stronger than you think,” he said. I cried. Four weeks later, I cried different tears as he took a video of me getting my chin — for the first time in my weak-armed life — over the bar. My trainer was barely more than an acquaintance, but he taught me how to pull myself up. — Marilyn Vaccaro",Marilyn Vaccaro

Instantly, we knew that, in different ways, we had each dressed for a date. Two children later, we still differ in many things: how to load the dishwasher and enforce bedtimes, but also, most importantly, how to lure each other back in. — Elizabeth Stark",Elizabeth Stark

Bruce came up to me, smiling and holding the biggest, ugliest, warty, mottled pumpkin and said, “I love this!” I had passed that pumpkin in the field earlier and thought, “That poor pumpkin needs someone to love it.” Ten years later, our blended family goes to the pumpkin patch each year. — Laura Macdonald",Laura Macdonald

Houston’s words kept running through my head: “Don’t trust your feelings / Love can be deceiving.” In August, before I left California, we locked eyes amid a sea of dancing bodies as the opening chords of “How Will I Know” crashed through speakers. I thought, triumphantly: I know. — Emmett Chen-Ran",Emmett Chen-Ran
322,2019-10-22T16:00:04+0000,Another Kind of Love,"On our first date we discussed your allergies — pineapples and beans. You seemed neurotic and funny. Our second, you talked about monkeys deprived of touch, choosing wooden dummies over food. I wanted to kiss you. Our third, I did. You didn’t kiss back. Fourth and fifth, we met as friends, but during the sixth, when you put your arm around me, I felt a flutter of hope. You later texted me a flower, saying you had no romantic feelings. I cried, but we are friends again and I accept it. There is love there, just another kind. — Belinda Hoey",Belinda Hoey
323,2019-10-15T18:00:04+0000,More Than I Imagined,"My son’s first love, at 15, was not what I imagined for him. She came from a family scarred by drug abuse and poverty. At 16, she got her G.E.D. and worked nights. He rode the bus to school. It won’t last, I thought. At 17, she got pregnant, and I agonized over his lost youth. When she miscarried, I saw them mourn. At 18, he moved in with her. It was not what I imagined for him. But on a recent night, as I watched them sword fighting with spatulas in the kitchen, I recognized real love. — Linda DeBerry",Linda DeBerry
324,2019-10-15T18:00:04+0000,The Lavender Was Too Short,"I had a bad summer cold. It was my idea to go to the lavender farm. The lavender was shorter than I imagined. I couldn’t smell a damn thing. We were in the right place at the wrong time. Or maybe the wrong place altogether. We had taken a trip, thinking a long weekend would help. Though there were things that were right about our marriage, it was becoming increasingly wrong. The getaway was full of drama, tears, great food and a breathtaking sunset. It was our last vacation together. In that place, on that weekend, an ending became right. — Michelle Pomerleau",Michelle Pomerleau
325,2019-10-15T18:00:04+0000,Good Thing He Didn’t Give Up His Seat for Me,"It was unsettling to find myself still single at 36. A married couple who had met at my 30th birthday party (lucky them) had a “dinner” one night, serving only cheese and wine. I nearly missed a flight the next morning, vomiting from the “dinner” of cheese and wine. Somehow I made it on the plane. With an eye to the bathroom, I asked the tall man in the aisle seat to trade for the window. “No, the legs — ” he said. Resigned, I navigated to my seat. But he felt bad. We talked. Turns out he was 36 and single too. Our daughter is now 13. — Leecia Manning",Leecia Manning
326,2019-10-15T18:00:04+0000,I Loved Their Son in Secret,"The sound of the garage door pulled us apart, a grating alarm signaling that his parents were home early. Wide-eyed and stammering, he gathered my things and heaved them — and me — out the back door. I redressed and tiptoed around the house, stopping beneath his parents’ window just as their light flicked on, the small shaft of light finding me like a spotlight on an escaped prisoner. If only they had opened the blinds, they would have seen the boy who loved their son in secret — but they never did, and we never met, and the light turned off. — Topher Daniel",Topher Daniel
327,2019-10-08T18:00:04+0000,"Sisters, With Nearly 30 Years Between Us","When Juliette was born, I didn’t want to meet her. A year passed before I fell in love with her piercing brown eyes looking up at me from our grandmother’s carpet. “Your half sister,” people say, until I correct them: “My sister.” Endless games and embraces dissolve our 29-year age difference. “Why leave?” she asks now, at 2, following me into the hallway of our father’s home. When I go, a little part of my heart breaks, until we see each other again and she makes it whole. — Audrey Guttman",Audrey Guttman
328,2019-10-08T18:00:04+0000,"We Know Where We Are, and It’s Not Paris","At Paddy’s Clam House in Manhattan, the maître d’ sat us in a cozy, poorly lit corner. Newly engaged, I leaned over and gave Gail a simple peck on the cheek. The maître d’ charged forward and said, in a disapproving tone, “Where do you think you are, Paris?” The question became code for furtive kisses in unanticipated places. Thirty-eight years later, we were at an airport in Paris, standing in line for our connecting flight to Kiev. I turned to Gail and, without a word, we smiled, kissed and exclaimed in unison, “Where do you think you are?” — Jay Chaskes",Jay Chaskes
329,2019-10-08T18:00:04+0000,Questions for My Love,"Tell me, my love: Why did I have cancer three times? How did we have two children with autism? Why has nothing turned out as planned? Then again: How are your same 10 jokes still funny? Why does your morning coffee still taste the best? Why, after 22 years together, does my heart still flutter when you walk in the room? How did I get so lucky to have your love? — Elizabeth Uzzo",Elizabeth Uzzo
330,2019-10-08T18:00:04+0000,Never Listen to Your Husband,"On our second date, Greg told me that he would rather create the perfect art installation than find the perfect mate. I didn’t listen. A few days before our wedding, I asked, “Do you think we’ll last forever?” He answered, “I think we’ll have at least a good five years.” After the third miscarriage, he worried that we wouldn’t make it through the gut-punch of a fourth. On our daughter’s fifth birthday, he wore a wig and chased eight tiny people around our tiny apartment. I’m glad I never listened to him. — Chloe Smith",Chloe Smith
331,2019-10-01T18:00:04+0000,He Tried So Hard to Remember Me,"When my 61-year-old father learned he had Alzheimer’s, we went to CVS together and bought the largest stack of notecards they sold. I asked, “What’s the town where you grew up?” We wrote Union Springs, Ala. I asked, “Who was your first kiss?” Amanda. Four years later, preparing to move my father into memory care, I packed up his desk. Taking the notecards felt silly, so I wrapped the long-forgotten stack in a rubber band and opened his drawer to toss them away. Inside, I found more notecards. They all said the same thing: my name. I collapsed to the floor. — Drew Hasson",— Drew Hasson
332,2019-10-01T18:00:04+0000,I Don’t Even Like Baby Ruths,"It was 1969 and we were 19-year-old camp counselors. He was Orthodox, innocent, working-class, Lower East Side. I was a Forest Hills hippie princess fallen upon hard times. As we waited with our fellow counselors for our evening assignments, he took a Baby Ruth out of his pocket, broke it neatly in half and gave me one of the halves. He didn’t ask if I wanted or even liked Baby Ruths (I don’t); he just handed it to me without comment. It took eight years to convince him to marry me, but that was the moment I knew. — Judith Mermelstein",Judith Mermelstein
333,2019-10-01T18:00:04+0000,Food = Love,"Every month, my family comes together at the same Korean barbecue restaurant in Bayside, Queens. My mother fills my plate with pieces of short rib faster than I can eat. My father does the same with my sister. We try to push back with our chopsticks, but my parents’ aged Korean hands have an unmatched dexterity. We take five bites for every one of theirs. They watch us eat, then pile on more. When they see that we’re stuffed, they beam. And though they barely ate, they suddenly look full too. — Royce Park",Royce Park
334,2019-10-01T18:00:04+0000,"Our Daughter, the Healer","As my husband held those 9 pounds 6 ounces of sweet newness, he looked at me and said, “Of course I forgive you. She is not a mistake. She is my child too.” In that operating room, I learned that my husband’s heart is larger than all of my guilt and shame. In his eyes, I am a human, worthy of forgiveness and compassion. She shares none of his DNA, but becoming her parents has been an opportunity to heal our wounds and learn how to love. — Sandra Portocarrero",Sandra Portocarrero
335,2019-09-24T19:00:03+0000,Words That Make Me Feel Less Alone,"Whenever I was in need of comfort as a child, my father would ask me, “¿Qué pasó, mi vida?” which means, “What happened, my life?” Like an incantation, these four words made me feel instantly less alone: What is happening to you is happening to me because you are my life. “¿Qué pasó, mi vida?” I now ask my partner when he wakes up with a headache. When he says he’s feeling flat. What is happening to him is happening to me because he, like my family, is my life. — Alexandra Clemente",Alexandra Clemente
336,2019-09-24T19:00:03+0000,“Just Us”,"I have always valued other peoples’ opinions over my own, wanting their approval to confirm that I was on the right path. It is such a blessing, then, to have a partner who couldn’t care less. When we go out, Justin sometimes asks for “just us” photos — selfies that we won’t share on social media. He’s shown me that our love doesn’t need endorsement because we already believe in it. (The irony of publicly sharing our story here is not lost on me.) — Hannah Rousselot",Hannah Rousselot

Jenny stops moving and stares. The robins sing. No words are spoken. Complete contentment in nature. She turns to me and plants an awkward, resolute kiss on my lips. It is only now in her teenage years that she can tolerate touch. I pull my autistic daughter to my breast and feel her love. — Grainne Armstrong",Grainne Armstrong
338,2019-09-24T19:00:03+0000,Third Time’s the Charm,"I was 58 with two broken marriages. My years spent on Match.com led to so many dates that I met the same woman for coffee twice without realizing it. Surrendering to the absurdity of it all, I changed my profile to say that I was “looking for a woman of incredibly poor judgment.” Christy was game, promising me lots of laughter. We met for a drink. The date lasted six hours, and we knew. Better late, right? No, best late. — Jay McDaniel",Jay McDaniel

Months later, as I walked around the apartment we were supposed to share, I shouted, “Where are you, you bastard?” When Rick took his last breath, my heart crumpled. No romance between us. We barely hugged. “You’re a lovely couple,” people would say. “A couple of what?” we’d respond. We were best friends, often found sitting on the couch, laughing like idiots. “Rick, we’re stupid,” I’d say. He’d answer, “Yes, but we’re happy.” — Betty Adorno",Betty Adorno
340,2019-09-17T19:00:02+0000,Our Return to Tenderness,"I used to lift you overhead, laughter reverberating from your infant throat. “You’re going to be a party girl,” I cooed. Your childhood was no party though. Custody battles. Your other mother won. At age 10, you were returned to me. During your teen years, that party girl let loose. Defiance, slammed doors, a DUI. Finally, you asked for help. “My baby’s inside there,” I said, pointing to your heart. “Take care of her.” Five months sober now, you say, “Show me how.” Once, you had no patience for tender words. Today you drink them in. — Tzivia Gover",.

When we met, we agreed: It wasn’t the sex that hurt, but the lying. So when Joshua told me that he was bisexual, I encouraged him to tell me if he met someone with whom he’d like to experiment. We met Tony in a performance of “The Rocky Horror Show.” We all played together onstage; then we started playing together offstage until things turned serious. Seven years later, we are a happy, faithful “throuple” (a trio as committed as a couple). — Briana McGuckin",Briana McGuckin

I couldn’t face my children’s searching eyes and endless questions, but I could call an electrician. John appeared the next day. Sharing a ladder, we struggled to mount a ceiling fan in the waning light of a summer evening. It was then, John said, in seeing my belly peeking from my shirt, that he fell for me, our shadows dancing on the walls. Apparently, the entire house had to be rewired. John made the right connections and, 18 years later, the light remains. — April Silva",April Silva
343,2019-09-10T19:26:33+0000,Manic Pixie Real Girl,"The first time I heard the term “manic pixie dream girl,” I felt a hot shame. My unique rebellions suddenly seemed small. My attempts at self-definition in vain. I wasn’t complex; I was caricature. Always an object, never a subject. Worse, I loved someone who needed me to stay that way. A man who needed me to remain a fantasy forever out of reach. I stepped closer anyway. “Don’t worry,” he said after we fought. “You’re still my muse.” “No,” I thought. “I’m an artist.” — Jerico Mandybur",Jerico Mandybur
344,2019-09-10T19:26:33+0000,Hugs Can Skip a Generation,"My Korean parents didn’t grow up with physical affection from their parents, so they didn’t know how to give it. Instead, they patted us on the back — the more vigorous the pat, the more they meant they loved us, were proud of us. I now watch my children, raised with uninhibited physical demonstrations of love, hug and kiss my parents, unabashedly telling them “I love you.” My parents physically reciprocate to their grandchildren in a way they still can’t with their own children. But that’s O.K. We had the shoulder pats. — Haley M. Hwang",Haley M. Hwang
345,2019-09-10T19:26:33+0000,Sometimes We Fight,"I threw a glass bottle on the floor. Shards of glass flew in every direction. “I hate you,” I screamed. My boyfriend, who had accidentally locked me out of our apartment at 3 a.m., sat motionless on the couch, spinning from alcohol and our disastrous party, unable to help. I curled up in tears in the kitchen, accompanied by one hungry mosquito. The next day, he cleaned up all the glass. He got cream for my bug bites. He said sorry. I said sorry. Sometimes little pieces of glass still get stuck in our feet. We just clean them up. — Aja Corliss",Aja Corliss
346,2019-09-10T19:26:33+0000,Seeing Her in Me,"“I’m sorry for your loss.” As if you’re lost, like a forgotten wallet or misplaced keys. A phrase used to empathize, to quell unease. I have said it too — about pets and strangers, but never about you. I find you in my deep-set eyes and the cheekbones below. My hands match yours 30 years ago. I see you in my summer tan that’s dark by mid-July, and in the lines that arc around my mouth if I laugh or cry. No, I haven’t lost you, Mom. That could never be.

I could resign myself to the company of dogs, getting a new one every 13 years or so until I —— Unwilling to finish that thought, I looked directly into the lens and ventured online one last time.

We would hitchhike to Stinson Beach, where we’d hide behind dunes, make out and touch. We were 15. After dinner at Ann’s house, her stepfather would race me home in his metallic blue Porsche, passing cars as fast as they appeared. One trip to the beach, we were picked up by stoned New Yorkers. Mesmerized by the windy mountain road, we sat in their old Impala with no seats, just pillows in the back. We had days of hands, and sun. — Mark Rice",Mark Rice

350,2019-09-03T20:12:14+0000,Speechless as Our Parents Chat,"Before our wedding, we took our parents to a restaurant to introduce them. We had worried about this meeting. It wasn’t just the religious and cultural divide (one Mexican Southern Baptist parent, two American secular Jews). It was that my father-in-law didn’t speak English, and my parents didn’t speak Spanish. Or so we thought. Once we were seated, my father-in-law started speaking in English; my mother replied in Spanish. We hadn’t considered the English my father-in-law picked up while living in Texas, or my mother’s affinity for language textbooks. My husband and I sat speechless as our parents chatted through lunch. — Catherine Komisaruk",Catherine Komisaruk

We moved to South Carolina 30 years ago. On an airport shuttle last week, I started to sit in a bench reserved for seniors when Kuniharu stopped me. “Those are for seniors,” he said.

The place I used to kiss before dozing off to the familiar sound of his heartbeat — the waves rocking as we would lie on our boat’s deck after bringing down the sails, the end to another day on the water. On my own after 14 years together, all I could manage to say was, “The Amstel river.” — Sjoerd van Elsen",Sjoerd van Elsen

Mid-celebration, I looked up from my cup of cold coconut soup to see my 8-year-old son, Asher, from my second marriage carry a chair over to my ex. Crouching on the grass beside his second wife’s seat, my ex startled at the sudden chair behind him. Then he turned to Asher — a child who wouldn’t exist had I not broken my ex-husband’s heart — and smiled. — Gayle Brandeis",Gayle Brandeis

Saturday nights consist of burgers and beers, “S.N.L.” and a shared bed. When we’re not together, we’re on the phone, worried when one of us gets sick, more worried than we were when we were young — and immortal. He calls me his girlfriend. I call him my boyfriend.

Psych 101 stressed the importance of telling children you love them. I asked my mother, “How come you rarely told me you loved me?” She replied, “Haven’t I always said how brilliant you are? How creative? How beautiful? How generous?

We spent the summer devising innocent reasons for our unrelated characters to be in the same space together; there weren’t many.

At last the day came: Aug. 15, 1969. We were going to Woodstock. I was 16, Paul 18. It is not that we were so young, though that is true. It’s that we fell in love for the rest of our lives. Subsequent lovers told us they could sense it and broke up with us, unwilling to be second fiddles. We married in 1987, finally admitting the fire was eternal.

Her hands were not always so pretty when she had worked typewriters, the earth in her many gardens, and snarls out of her children’s hair. These were hands that had washed, folded, mended, ironed, stacked, and stowed ceaselessly. Now, they lay warm and still as life left her.

I drove past places big and small, thinking about the lives we would live in them. The townhouse where I would make patty-melts and we would watch college football. Or the ranch-style one where we would celebrate our baby’s first birthday. Both scenarios remain fantasies.

Although I prefer the guys I date to be taller than me, this wasn’t what I had in mind. There are challenges. Reaching for his hand reminds me of my kindergarten days, my arm extended at full length to tug at my mother’s skirt. When waiting in line, he sometimes uses my head as an armrest. Yes, he’s the type of person I would hate sitting behind at concerts or movies, but, luckily, he chooses to be by my side. — Roan Raymundo",Roan Raymundo
368,2019-08-06T19:00:10+0000,Timothy Is Waiting for Me,"When I visit my parents in Arizona, I sleep in my childhood bedroom. The dogs are always happy to see me. After one trip, I decided to take an evening flight back to New York. I packed my belongings and said my goodbyes. Waiting in the airport security line, I opened a text my mother had sent: a picture of our Chihuahua waiting on the bed. I cried. It seemed that Timothy, who had slept next to me throughout my visit, had not been told that I left. — Elizabeth Hernandez",Elizabeth Hernandez
369,2019-08-06T19:00:10+0000,Vision Optional,"Fifteen years ago, meeting online meant sharing stories about yourself rather than swiping right. John and I hit it off instantly, jokes and anecdotes flowing. After three weeks of messaging, I was more than interested. He was hilarious, intelligent, successful and kind. And, it turns out, visually impaired — so visually impaired that future blindness is a possibility. I closed my laptop to consider, giving myself 24 hours to think, but I only needed two. Blindness wasn’t a choice for him; why should it be for me? Hearts required, vision optional. — Jennifer Haendel",Jennifer Haendel
370,2019-07-30T19:00:05+0000,What My Twin Understands,"My twin brother has autism and can’t talk much. I’m a writer. Mother says I sucked out all the words from him in the womb. When we were 12, I walked into my brother’s room and simply said, “I’m gay.” I had never said those words out loud before. I figured he couldn’t tell anyone even if he wanted to. He looked at me, his expression unchanged. I started to cry. My twin didn’t understand what I had told him, or what being gay meant, but he saw that I was sad and reached out for my hand. — Sarah Emily Baum",Sarah Emily Baum
371,2019-07-30T19:00:05+0000,"Not Poly, Not Single, Not Yet","We’re not dating, but we’re still sleeping together three years after breaking up. Sleeping — not having sex. So we’re married? Ha. We can date other people if we want. So, we’re open? No, “open” implies a relationship. Are we poly? No. Single? Technically. And we have no desire to date? Not at the moment. We are more than friends but less than partners. Maybe not “less.” This girl is my soul mate. Would I someday like to marry her? Someday. Maybe. When we’re like 60. Sometimes if feels as if we already are. — Chris Gilmore",Chris Gilmore
372,2019-07-30T19:00:05+0000,A Teacher’s Faith,"I flunked Chem II, which was especially humiliating for the daughter of a renowned scientist. “I’m not worried about your grade,” my teacher said, smiling. “I know that someday I’m going to have your books on my shelf.” I was stunned by his gift of faith. I felt as if I were flunking life, but he had seen my writing in the school paper. Twenty years later, I sent him a copy of my first published book. “I used your book in my retirement talk,” he wrote back. “Then I went home and put it on my shelf.” — Pamela Jane",Pamela Jane

Later, at home, she will tell my father, “It looked good on me but better on Sydney.” My father will gently chastise her for thinking that her body, which has given birth to four children, should look anything like mine. The truth is that my mother does love her body, but she is in awe of the body that hers created 21 years ago. — Sydney Kemme Nash",Sydney Kemme Nash
374,2019-07-23T19:35:44+0000,Bye Bye “Family” Minivan,"The “family” minivan — that he said we needed, but that I should buy, for road trips to visit his son in Los Angeles, and his daughter in Santa Barbara, and to take our two boys camping and biking and skiing; the “family” minivan that he encouraged me to purchase just the year before, when he knew what he was doing and with whom, and so he knew that we were over, doomed, but was too afraid to say, and for which I later blamed him every time I looked in my driveway — has been sold. — Kyrie Robinson",Kyrie Robinson

Was I truly allowing my toddler to get a multicolored pedicure? What kind of a self-absorbed monster was I raising? Just two years ago, my child was fighting for her life, spending months in the hospital, undergoing multiple procedures. Her feet and hands swallowed up by giant IVs, she nursed unimaginable pain for a tiny person. Today she is thriving. She can paint her nails any color, any day, for the rest of her life. — Gabriela Revilla Lugo",Gabriela Revilla Lugo
376,2019-07-23T19:35:44+0000,Our Four Secret Years,"I didn’t want to fall in love with her. I had a husband. I led worship at my church. Naturally, my affection was unnatural. Then why did it feel right? How could love be wrong? Perhaps only those who have tried not to fall in love understand fully why it’s called falling. You can’t stop it. Can’t feel the earth beneath your feet. Leaving our husbands, we had four secret years. Then she left me for a man. She couldn’t be open about us. Not “strong enough,” she said. Fifteen years later, I still cry. — Paula Wescott",Paula Wescott

My father and I had been waiting, hopeful but frightened. We wondered: Will he be able to talk? To walk? To feed or bathe himself? The predictive tests hadn’t been encouraging. So we stared, and after a while my husband’s blue eyes focused on mine. Then he sputtered and coughed. We stared. He blinked. We stared. Finally, I whispered, “How are you, love?” He sighed and said, “Well, I’ve been mostly dead all day.” — Lisa Petty",Lisa Petty
378,2019-07-23T19:35:44+0000,She Waters Me Every Day,"My girlfriend, Emma, makes me drink water. I don’t like it, that magical liquid scientists claim is necessary for survival. If it were up to me, I would start the morning with three cups of coffee and maybe a mug of tea in the afternoon, followed by a few sips of lemonade with dinner. Alas, it’s not up to me. At 4 p.m., Emma asks, “How much water have you had today?” When I feel dizzy, she puts her water bottle in my hands. She loves me, so she waters me like a favorite plant in order to watch me grow. — Mary Drue Hall",Mary Drue Hall
379,2019-07-16T19:00:06+0000,Second Time at the Hitching Post,"Almost 50 years ago, Sue and I hurriedly married to avoid the embarrassment of being unwed parents in seven months. The ceremony remains a blur but the declaration of “Until death do us part” was unforgettable. Five years and two children later, we divorced. A few months ago, I was given the prognosis of one to two years of life. When I shared the news with Sue, she offered to care for me. Last month, we remarried. Our daughter was our witness as we declared once again: “Until death do us part.” — Rodney Santos",Rodney Santos
380,2019-07-16T19:00:06+0000,Running the Reservoir Alone,"Two suburban boys fell in love over the spring. I chose a college in the city to stay with him and, after an ultimatum, he moved into a cramped apartment to stay with me. Most nights, we would log a mile around the Central Park reservoir together, hearing the rocks shuffle underneath our shoes. Happy only through this constant movement, we found the stillness of our small apartment too difficult. I run the reservoir alone now, hoping to hear the shuffling of rocks underneath his shoes as he catches up to my breathless body. — Jared Hirsch",Jared Hirsch
381,2019-07-16T19:00:06+0000,He Won’t Stop Getting Down on One Knee,"We’ve been married for five years and have two children. We rarely argue, but if we get into an argument in public — walking down the street or in a restaurant — Paul will drop to one knee, take my hand in his, look up at me lovingly and ask, “Will you please forgive me?” Cars begin honking, people stare and the waitress starts ordering a dessert on the house, to my absolute horror. Reminded why I said yes to him in the first place, I say yes again. — Lauren Gray",Lauren Gray
382,2019-07-16T19:00:06+0000,I Got My Father-in-Law in the Divorce,"I met my new boyfriend’s father at their family holiday party; we sat in a corner, gabbing intensely. My boyfriend wondered what we were talking about. Hugging his father goodbye, I thought, “I’m going to marry your son.” I did. When he retired, we met occasionally for breakfast; now it’s monthly. I told him when I was conflicted about my marriage. He held my hand. As we separated two years ago, my ex said, “Don’t worry, I would never come between you and my dad.” “You misunderstand,” I said. “You can’t. I get Norman in the divorce. You get visitation.”— Alia Covel",Alia Covel

It’s possible that I, the Scottish cook in the tenement kitchen in Glasgow, would have never met Peter, the American divinity student volunteering there that summer. Serving soup on July 20, 1969, the day Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, I declared the mission a waste of resources. Peter countered that it was a momentous achievement. Arguing passionately, we found attraction amid disagreement. Fifty years on, we still disagree about space exploration, but we celebrate that auspicious day when the moon brought us into the same orbit. — Jenny Fleming-Ives",Jenny Fleming-Ives

Knee-deep in single parenthood and at the end of my ability to cajole, coax, encourage or demand, I turned to look him square in the eye. “I can’t do this on my own,” I said. “We need to work together.” He met my gaze, dropped his tantrum and ran toward me. We have been a team ever since. — Elizabeth Keen",Elizabeth Keen
385,2019-07-09T19:00:07+0000,A Warm Meal for My Brother,"My big brother and I giggled at our successful disobedience as we traded comic books, flashlights bobbing between our beds. He was my friend, the two of us bonded by years of childhood mischief. Decades later, leaving a blues venue, I realized it had been six years since I’d known my brother’s whereabouts. He would have loved the performance. Outside, a stranger approached. “Spare $5 for a sandwich?” he asked. Looking into his eyes, I wondered when my brother had last savored a warm meal. To this stranger’s delight, I pulled out $20. That night, I fed my brother.— Cassandra Lund",Cassandra Lund
386,2019-07-09T19:00:07+0000,"Yes, Rabbis Play Pool","My friend wanted to set us up. I said the 17-year age gap was too great, and besides, I would never date a rabbi. She brought him to our weekly pub trivia game, “just as a friend, no pressure.” Up close, I noticed eye crinkles from a lifetime of smiling, his booming laugh. Later, I saw him walking home in the rain. He accepted my ride offer. Our first date was shooting pool in a bar. My non-Jewish friends were incredulous: “Rabbis do that?” Yes, they do. Rabbis shoot pool in dive bars, caulk your tub, hold your gaze and win your heart. — Tova Tenenbaum",Tova Tenenbaum
387,2019-07-09T19:00:07+0000,Maybe It Just Stopped Being Good,"Maybe he didn’t love me from the beginning. Maybe I shouldn’t have accepted his mother’s engagement ring. Maybe he didn’t mean it when he held me close. Maybe I expected too much of him. Maybe we shouldn’t have bought that house, built the barn, so carefully tended the chickens and sheep, the roses and raspberries. Maybe we shouldn’t have moved to India. Maybe if I hadn’t needed him to help me take care of my mother. Maybe if he had been different. Maybe if I had been. Maybe not. But maybe. — Judith Edmister",Judith Edmister
388,2019-07-09T19:00:07+0000,No Labels,"His dating profile read “conservative.” Wary, I said yes anyway. While working full-time and raising two children, he was studying for his third master’s degree. “Why?” I asked. “I like learning. It’s fun.” He listened to understand, not plan his counterattack. He shared his opinions openly but only if I asked. He taught me to think more logically; I raised his emotional I.Q. On the topic of marriage? We both said yes. We are registered Independents now, but we rarely discuss politics at home. We discuss faith and forgiveness and keeping labels out of love. — Elizabeth Watson Chaney",Elizabeth Watson Chaney

Miles away from the nearest Alabama volunteer fire department, we tried to put out the flames with the garden hose. Hours later, amid the blackened walls and stench of burned furniture and plastic, we finally slept. The next morning, I wept as we stood in what was left of the kitchen. My darling reached up to the sooted ceiling with one finger and wrote, “Will you marry me?” I stopped crying just long enough to reach up and write, “O.K.” — Gita Maritzer Smith",Gita Maritzer Smith

My 14-year-old granddaughter called me of her own volition with her just-purchased first phone. It wasn’t a text, or a message on Facebook, Twitter, Skype or Instagram, none of which I truly understand. It was a real old-fashioned phone call, her first to me ever. She called to mourn Notre-Dame because we had been there, just the two of us, on a recent trip. We shared our sadness and our love. — Iris Shur",Iris Shur

My favorite is summer. In the summer, we sleep naked. — Megan Schippmann",Megan Schippmann

We called it our 125th birthday party. Our friends socialized while “Harold and Maude” played in the background. Despite that celebration of age, I recently felt lost while looking at my wrinkles in the mirror. I told Deji, “I don’t know who I am anymore; I don’t recognize myself.” He said, “Don’t worry, Gerri — I know who you are.” — Gerri Caldarola",Gerri Caldarola

Each time we stopped, Aslan pressed his golden head against my hip. “Choose me,” his brown eyes seemed to say. “I belong with you.” I agreed. But we still had to prove that we could work together as a team. I rolled up to a closed door, Aslan at my side. He tossed that great head of his, pushed the handicapped plate with his nose, then glanced back to make sure I had noticed. That’s when I knew he was mine. The door swung open. — Jeanne Marie McArdle",me

I waited tables at the resort where city dwellers came for lobster and loon song. He washed the dishes I passed him across the kitchen’s steel table. He reached out to me with his quiet, gloved hands. I offered him shells and husks, my hopeful smile. After work, we met by the water. If we were patient, across the lake’s untroubled sheen came the voice of the loon, the peace we had traveled far to find, a flash of fireflies as his eyes met mine. — Nicola Waldron",
395,2019-06-25T19:00:05+0000,“To Live and Die in the Dark”,"In high school, we watched “Brokeback Mountain” in the movie theater, a secret date. The story on the screen was set in rural Wyoming in the early 1960s. We lived in a liberal state, New York, in the mid-2000s. As the movie played, we settled into the theater’s darkness, held hands, touched legs. My head rested on his shoulder. When the movie ended and the lights came up, we had already pulled apart. A world away and generations later than the cowboys on the screen, what we shared was also doomed to live and die in the dark. — Seamus Kirst",Seamus Kirst

José, the maintenance man, came, wielding a sawed-off table leg — “the Rat Bat” — which he used to chase the rat (and all other demons) out. We toasted to my newly sanctified home, my loneliness melting like the condensation on our beers before José said, “My wife awaits.” He turned his phone toward me, tapping the background photo of a beaming woman. “Twenty-three years and it’s still all love.” My current home is free from both memories and vermin. But the Rat Bat remains: Excalibur, purger of hurt, welcomer of love. — Mickey O’Neill",Mickey O’Neill

My child who struggled for so long found a first-time home buyer assistance program and earned a matching grant. My firstborn whose future I questioned — would he ever become independent? — met with loan officers, talked with bankers, engaged a realtor. My Matthew closed the deal on a two-bedroom, one-bath bungalow with hardwood floors, a funky kitchen and a screened-in porch. My son, diagnosed with a brain tumor at age 11, exceeds my every expectation. My heart. It’s bursting. — Karen DeBonis",Karen DeBonis

We cooed at kittens and fell in love with a lab named Adidas. It wasn’t until the shelter worker asked if we wanted a same-day adoption that he put on the brakes. “You have three roommates and are moving abroad in four months,” he reminded me. A good partner, I realized, will play along until your desires get irresponsible — dreaming with a healthy dose of reality. — Meera Kumar",Meera Kumar
399,2019-06-18T19:00:06+0000,India Is an Ache,"Landing in Mumbai feels like releasing a breath I didn’t know I had been holding. My husband remembers India as dirt, poverty, noise. I remember aromas of masala-fried pomfret, generosity of gruff cabbies saying, “No madam, you keep the change,” daylong cries of crows, hawkers, doorbells. In America, I play music to curb silences. For me, India is no longer a country; it’s an ache. I left the place I love for the man I love. It’s not a complaint. I’m only saying, sometimes, the most unconditional of loves are also the most inconvenient. — Kanika Punwani Sharma",Kanika Punwani Sharma

We start each day with the crossword and end it playing cards. We dry mangoes for pickling, feed cows leftover roti and make model airplanes. When we do talk, I ask you about serving in the Indian Air Force, about migrating from Lahore to Amritsar during Partition. Every July on my birthday, I ask what my mother was like at my age. I tell you you’re the best Nana, and you just smile gently and hold my hand. — Anisha Chadha",Anisha Chadha

Our families couldn’t know. Kruttik was Hindu; I was Muslim. An impossible union. When my mother eventually found out, my family acted like a loved one had died. Seven years of tears, family estrangement and emotional torture later, Kruttik and I married in three ceremonies in three Indian cities, trying to keep the Hindu and the Muslim gods happy. That was 12 years ago. We have two daughters and a new sense of family now. We are also atheists. — Zainab Zaki",Zainab Zaki

He wrote bad poetry. I left fawning comments. Long emails “explaining” his poems followed (“Mansplaining” was, sadly, not yet a term). When blogging went kaput, I lost him in the digital wonderlands. Last year, we connected on LinkedIn. Turns out, he has traded poetry for something called Blockchain. — Radhika Venkatarayan",Radhika Venkatarayan

Four years later, we met again while she was visiting New York City. This time I told her I loved her and asked if she would be with me. “Maybe,” she said. Two years later (to my surprise) she agreed to marry me, saying, “I do but my answer is still maybe.” Thirty years and two children later, she continues to tell me “maybe.” OMG!

404,2019-06-18T19:00:06+0000,“Why Is He With Her?”,"“She’s pretty, for a dark-skinned girl.” I heard this often growing up in skin-color-obsessed India. We met in college. Nishanth was a handsome, light-skinned man. He loved me for who I was and never considered my skin color. But friends, family and strangers did and wondered, some quietly, others aloud: “Why is he with her?” His family objected. What would people think if he were to bring a dark-skinned girl into their light-skinned family? We fought to be together. Twenty years and a son later, Nishanth still sees me, not my complexion. — Deepthi Nishanth",Deepthi Nishanth
405,2019-06-11T19:52:04+0000,Running Is Like Love,"We compared racing milestones and goals the first time we met because that’s what runners do. Obnoxious, I know. Turns out we had entered the same race a year before and finished 25 seconds apart. Cute. Even so, there was no rushing into love. Cautious, and a bit jaded after failed relationships, we became casual running buddies. Training for events set the tone for an eventual partnership: pacing, passion, commitment. For us, running is like love: challenging, addictive and capable of producing the most euphoric highs. — Christina Martinez",Christina Martinez
406,2019-06-11T19:52:04+0000,The 48th Date,"As a lonely gay man who seldom went to bars, gyms or theaters, I resorted to a gay matchmaker. I ate 47 meals with 47 men, none of them a match. Then I had a dinner with Steve, a man with whom I shared low compatibility on paper but high in person. During our 30 years together, we formalized our relationship with a Vermont civil union, a New Jersey domestic partnership, a Canadian same-sex marriage and, finally, legal marriage in the United States. We framed each certificate, creating a personal exhibit in the larger gallery of L.G.B.T.Q. human rights progress. — Lou Storey",Lou Storey

I turned to Mr. Wonderful, who I thought would bring joy back to me. Instead, he brought bruises, broken bones, a more-broken heart. Again I was on my own, failing Elizabeth miserably. For five years I wandered. Then, one day, I cleaned out Elizabeth’s backpack and found her essay, “Why My Mom is My Hero.” We had survived, and then some. — Julie McMurray",Julie McMurray
408,2019-06-11T19:52:04+0000,A Heavenly Body,"I remember that cold night sky, the stars so near. We looked up in amazement, at each other just as much as at Orion, standing tall above us. I don’t recall any words. I see it as a snapshot, as if I am Orion, peering down from afar, wondering what will happen next. In reality, I do know. You opened that huge wool coat — the one your uncle had given to a southern boy moving north — and pulled me into your Louisiana sunshine. Now, this is where I stand with your loss.

A few weeks later, in the heat of June, I knew I had found my soul mate as we walked along Broadway — strolling through the island’s changing neighborhoods from Inwood to the tip of Battery Park. Though he has never wanted to go for a long walk again, there is no one with whom I would rather walk through life. — Mishi Faruqee",Mishi Faruqee

We spoke often by phone, working together for our clients. After eight years of calls, we started meeting in person. She talked about her travels. I talked about my children. One night, while she was washing dinner dishes, I thought, “Those are the most beautiful hands I’ve ever seen.” It took me three days to be sure before I told her I loved her. It took a month for her to believe me. We’ve been together 18 years. — Mary Romeyn",Mary Romeyn
411,2019-06-04T19:00:08+0000,Storming Into Kindergarten,"It was the first of many first days of school. I walked in little steps toward the classroom, my parents striding beside me. Eager to take kindergarten by storm, I reminded myself that I had to make friends. I sat down next to a girl who was as tiny as I was, with my favorite topic in mind. I said, “Do you know my granny Alba?” My potential new friend’s eyes opened wide with curiosity. My parents laughed by the door.

This financial reality meant we would need to leave our beloved Manhattan apartment and move in with my parents in New Jersey. I dreaded the conversation. Just three months into retirement, my parents had finally begun to enjoy their empty nest. I was sweating when I called and had barely begun to explain our new circumstances when my mother said, “Of course you’ll stay with us.” Later, my father sent an email with a floor plan.

For a week, our house had thrilled to the sounds of small feet on stairs, stories being read, spoons clinking against cereal bowls. Now my littlest grandchild’s tricycle was put into the van’s hatch, the door slammed, the engine started. We leaned in for last hugs. As their car backed away, the sense of loss was sudden and sharp.

On our honeymoon, a hurricane struck Cancún. Diverted to Nassau, we fled our hotel because of a fire; the concierge booked us a new room with ceiling plaster littering the bed. While snorkeling, Jim’s wedding band disappeared. He quit searching at dusk. I continued, for years, along other shorelines. Last summer, I lazily stopped wearing my ring. In Scotland for our October anniversary, Jim noticed and felt hurt. But I have let go of signs, symbols. Thirty years is proof enough. — Linda Lowen",Linda Lowen
415,2019-05-28T19:00:02+0000,An Elephant Named Donna,"When I was 3 months old, my father bought me an elephant named Donna. We kept her in our two-acre yard in Orange, Conn. My only “memories” of Donna are from other peoples’ stories: the enormous piles of dung my brothers had to shovel, the time she ate my mother’s rose bushes, her “bedroom” fashioned out of a converted garage. My father was a diesel truck mechanic and my mother a homemaker. We weren’t rich, just working-class people. “Love makes you do crazy things,” my father liked to say. — Judith Nacca",Judith Nacca
416,2019-05-28T19:00:02+0000,"What Love Was, the First Time","I was 16 with Pakistani parents as traditional as they come. His family was proudly American, too proud for a brown girl like me. Neither house held open doors so we scrambled into my parent’s Pontiac. Each kiss was resistance. Legs cramped as the hours passed, but cup holders held sustenance in the form of strawberry milkshakes. That first love was finding obscure parking lots and fogging up windows. It was discovering clothes in the back seat and smirking as I was driven to church on a Sunday. — Sharmeen Chauhdry",
417,2019-05-28T19:00:02+0000,Pierce My Ears or Run Away?,"The kitchen whiteboard was erased, replaced by our 7-year-old’s survey: “Isabel is going to get her ears perest or run away. Wich one do you choose?” “P. S. Once you choose you have to let her do it!!” Then a chart, with choices: “ears perst” or “runaway.” “Put a ✔ in the spase you want.” To her older brother: “Jeff you have to do it as if you incredibly cared for me.” Lastly: “P.S. I don’t care if I spell thing rong.” Proud of Isabel’s defiance and ingenuity, my wife and I eventually let her get her ears “perst.” — Robert Schroeder",Robert Schroeder
418,2019-05-28T19:00:02+0000,Caught in a Maze,"There were signs she liked me. An invitation here, a late-night text there. The excitement, smiles and sincerity — all of which I was too clueless to notice. Then came a deliciously warm night, fueled by cheap drinks and music in a dimly lit Shanghai karaoke establishment. A missing cellphone, a search through a maze of hallways, a slowed pace, an interlocking of arms, a quiet “Can I kiss you?” As my oblivious mind tried to come to its senses, I blurted: “Sorry, but are you gay?” A few years later, I can proudly confirm that we both are. — Elizabeth Forman",Elizabeth Forman
419,2019-05-28T19:00:02+0000,“Hey” Is Not “Heyy”,"“Heyy,” his message read. My heart fluttered. One “y” may have left me upset, but the second “y” — that was promising. Such a simple yet ambiguous greeting. Did he want to hang out? Was he going to confess his love? Oh! He was typing. A double text! It was my lucky day. I broke a sweat waiting for his response. How should I respond? “Hi!”? “I am in love with you”? My message had to show the same amount of interest as his. He responded! “Sorry didn’t mean the extra ‘y.’” Oh. — Julia DiGeronimo",Julia DiGeronimo
420,2019-05-21T19:00:02+0000,Inseparable Twins,"Sick of being “the twins,” we made rules for freshman year. Keep my hair short and red, Anushka’s brown and long. Live in different dorms. Sit on opposite sides of lectures (nature and nurture against us, we’re both biology majors). No eating in the same dining hall or going to the same parties. Meet once a week, max. That didn’t last. I couldn’t live apart from someone who’s a part of me. After a year of enduring impossible problem sets, roommate drama, assorted heartbreaks and our parents’ divorce, we laugh at how we once thought we’d do it alone. — Anjali Walia, Yale University","Anjali Walia, Yale University"
421,2019-05-21T19:00:02+0000,A Frozen Moment,"I flew to Idaho over winter break to see Sumner’s hometown. Our first night, we went skating on a frozen pond, surrounded by snow. I was nervous. I didn’t play sports growing up, and I hadn’t ice skated since I was a child. He circled the pond, not showing off, simply enjoying the movement. I’ll never forget the stars piercing the darkness and the shadowy outline of the towering mountains. Fifteen minutes later, I realized I had forgotten that I was supposed to learn how to skate; I had just been watching him the whole time. — Zipi Diamond, St. Olaf College","Zipi Diamond, St. Olaf College"
422,2019-05-21T19:00:02+0000,Waiting for the Buffering to End,"My boyfriend and I try to have a date night every weekend. Typical, except our dates span two time zones and 1,800 miles. I attend college in Ohio, and he in Arizona. Love, for us, has become FaceTiming during meals (so we don’t have to eat alone), packing his favorite baked goods ever-so-tightly so they don’t go stale in the mail, and pausing the Netflix movie because the other person’s laptop is buffering. We sprint through the airport one way and trudge the other. It’s not an easy relationship, but it’s ours. — Gina Deaton, Xavier University","Gina Deaton, Xavier University"
423,2019-05-21T19:00:02+0000,“Am I Safe?”,"Tears welled as I realized the contrast between us and the couple a few feet over, watching the same flamenco show. They were in their mid-20s with vibrant chemistry, his arm around hers, feeding each other from their shared plate. Patrick and I sat across from each other, our physical contact limited to footsie hidden under the table. My anguish turned to rage that we live in a world where I cannot love as uncompromisingly as a straight person, in which every display of affection comes with the thought, “Am I safe?” — Christian Correa, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Christian Correa, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"
424,2019-05-21T19:00:02+0000,An Edible Bouquet,"It was Valentine’s Day, and I was his first girlfriend. He nervously asked me if I wanted flowers. I jokingly said I’d rather have bacon.

425,2019-05-21T19:00:02+0000,Fumbling With Love,"Freshman year, our rooms feet apart. Arturo and I barely saw the sun that winter, only each other. As snow piled up, we bonded over our immigrant backgrounds with microwave popcorn under string lights. He kissed me even though I had mono (but never got sick). We were virgins to love, fumbling with its magnificence like we fumbled with belt buckles and bra straps. Then we broke up, still living only feet apart, followed by a summer of pining playlists and blocked calls. Next year, across campus, a shared strawberry crepe. Somehow, by growing apart, we had grown back together. — Magdalena Mihaylova, University of Michigan","Magdalena Mihaylova, University of Michigan"
426,2019-05-21T19:00:02+0000,A Scarier Kind of Gravity,"How to meet cute: 1. Exploit Tinder to deal with your fidgety fingers. 2. Make plans to meet in Central Park, but don’t send your location (“Let’s play hide and seek — black dress”). 3. Withhold your outrage when he gives up and says to look for him instead. 4. Spin in frustrated circles until you spot him on top of a rock. 5. Instantly overcome your fear of heights to climb to him. 6. Over the next three hours, succumb to a much different, much scarier kind of gravity. 7. Delete Tinder. — Linh Nguyen, Princeton University","Linh Nguyen, Princeton University"
427,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,Broadcasting the Truth,"The things I was too scared to say to him in person, I would talk about on my podcast. I knew he’d be listening. My medication? Yes. Sexual history? Sure. Fears? I’d pepper these throughout the episodes. “It’s funny,” he’d say. “I’m learning so much about you. All I have to do is listen to your podcast.” With my lips to the microphone and his earphones at the ready, I thought I was saving us from having to discuss the awkward topics face-to-face, but without that vulnerability, we never stood a chance. Like every episode, the end was inevitable. — Louis Hanson, University of Sydney, Australia","Louis Hanson, University of Sydney, Australia"
428,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,Did He Like My Smile or My Race?,"We met on Bumble just before winter break. After a six-hour-long first date, the Harvard boy seemed promising. Frequent texts, plans for dates, a spontaneous trip to his hometown to see him. We both felt like we were understood. Months later, when meeting again in person, he said, “I’m not romantically attracted to you anymore.” I nodded. It happens. Sad but acceptable. Then he said, “By the way, I don’t have an Asian fetish.” Which made me wonder: Did he like the smile on my face or was he fixated on race? — Connie Chung, Boston University","Connie Chung, Boston University"
429,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,It’s All About the Perfect Post,"Graduation is a weird thing, not that I have gotten quite there yet. The Canadian snow has almost melted, exam season is upon us and we all have our responses ready for the inevitable question: “So, what are your plans after graduation?” I’ve met hundreds, maybe thousands of people during my time here, but only a few close friends, dear to my heart, who will go to great lengths to guarantee I get the perfect graduation ball photo to post for all my Facebook followers. — Alexandra Yiannoutsos, McGill University","Alexandra Yiannoutsos, McGill University"
430,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,A Rap for Rebecca,"Was surrounded by my pals, but my mind was on a gal. Her car pulled up and that was it — should’ve put cuffs around my wrists. My heart beat red then flashed blue (felt sad that the party was through). Only time she had my spirits low wasn’t her fault; she simply had to go. I wanted her to come back, kept messaging like a maniac. Four years later, she’s still here, slapping at my hand that nervously tugs at my ear. Grabbing my waist during concerts as if she protects me from monsters. — Joshua Corona, California State University of Northridge","Joshua Corona, California State University of Northridge"
431,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,Love in 5 to 7 Business Days,"After our first date, he said, “My people will get back to your people for some feedback assessment, and in 5 to 7 business days, I’ll get back to you.” He made me laugh, and I was determined to make him feel just as sunny. Within a few hours, I created and sent a Google form to him (in his favorite color) with questions like, “Did Madison make good eye contact?” “Was the conversation intellectually and/or emotionally stimulating?” “Was she pleasing to the eye?” He filled it out and sent it to me. Had I been stimulating? “Hell yes!” — Madison Catrett, Duke University","Madison Catrett, Duke University"
432,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,“Demoted from Muse to Memory”,"I’ve always wanted to find another girl who had love songs written about her, mostly so I could ask what she did with them after the relationship was over. How did she reconcile being demoted from muse to memory? My ex-boyfriend released his favorite song, about the strength of our love, on Spotify four days before he broke up with me. The song kept being recommended. I forced myself to listen. At first, I felt numb, the song sounding empty. Then it sounded like a sepia-tone photograph, dripping with nostalgia. Now over him, I don’t hear anything anymore. — Julia James, University of Mississippi","Julia James, University of Mississippi"
433,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,The Real Celestial Event,"The image through the telescope seems tiny, almost inconsequential. I tell this to my boyfriend, who scoffs, “Speak for yourself.” Colin is the kind of person who keeps track of eclipses — it was he who introduced me to the observatory across from where he had worked. Colin is always telling me that the next eclipse won’t appear for another century, yet endless celestial events continue to arise. Sometimes the moments around these are more memorable than the events themselves. I love a natural orange, but the blood moon only felt special when framed by the sunroof of his car. — Jeremy Wolin, Brown/Rhode Island School of Design","Jeremy Wolin, Brown/Rhode Island School of Design"
434,2019-05-14T19:00:01+0000,"No, We Totally Didn’t Meet on Tinder","Neither of us wanted to tell our parents we met on Tinder, so we spent spring break texting about alternatives. Did we sit together in a crowded dining hall? Too obvious. Blind date that a mutual friend set up? Too improbable. He caught me falling while ice skating? Too cheesy. Maybe I stopped him on his way to fencing practice to ask about his sword? I’m too shy. He joked that we were rewriting the Train song, “50 Ways to Say Goodbye,” except instead of the ways I left, we would end up with the 50 ways we’d met. — Kelly McKewin, Miami University","Kelly McKewin, Miami University"
435,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,"For Once, I Wanted Less","Through much of college I avoided romance because I wanted more: more knowledge, more goals, always striving. Then I fell for a close friend. The first morning I woke up to him — gentle arms, even breathing in the gray dawn — was the first time I wanted less. Less work. Less time committed to calendars. Nothing more than this small, simple present lasting. — Liana Wang, Yale University","Liana Wang, Yale University"
436,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,One Obvious Pro,"I grew up in a small town where same-sex relationships were considered abnormal and wrong. As I struggled with my sexuality, I began wondering, “Should I even try to have a romantic relationship?” When I left for college and fell for a girl, I was afraid to act on my feelings. My friend, John, came to my dorm to help me weigh the pros and cons of pursuing her. Later, I looked over the list by myself. John had written mostly jokes, except for one word: “Love?” — Gabriella Vacarelo, University of Massachusetts Amherst","Gabriella Vacarelo, University of Massachusetts Amherst"
437,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,We Weren’t Dreaming,"Our lives aligned for 22 days. For different reasons, it was not meant to be. She had to leave Lebanon and return to school in the Netherlands. Soon, it will be time for me to return to school in Spain. Strangers in Beirut, we walked around, stopping for coffee, tea, beer or wine. We could barely stop talking — but, in retrospect, my favorite moments were the few silent ones. One wintry night, she lit the wrong end of a cigarette at my window. We laughed, but I kept it. I wanted a reminder, after leaving the city (our city), that we were not dreaming. — Álvaro Fernández Cruz, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain","Álvaro Fernández Cruz, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"
438,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,Taylor Swift Advice From Mom,"I’ve never been in love, but I’ve learned that maybe it’s O.K. I’ve spent too much time thinking about love, trying to figure out why I haven’t found it. Navigating the world of college boys feels like assimilating into a new country, as if it’s my first year again, my visa freshly stamped. Thankfully, an email from across time zones reminds me of the love I already hold. “RE: Advice?” my mother writes. “When you’re ready, you’ll know it … so never sell yourself short … And then it’s really wonderful and heartbreaking and all the things Taylor Swift writes songs about.” — Hadley Menk, University of St. Andrews, Scotland","Hadley Menk, University of St. Andrews, Scotland"
439,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,Fight or Flight,"I don’t think I understood the “fight-or-flight response” properly until I experienced it. My body would freeze when I kissed someone, alarm bells blaring in my head. My heartbeat would fill my ears and zap my brain. But one day I met someone who held me while I cried, who wanted to help, wanted to listen. He showed me that touch could be about sharing instead of taking. Touch could be about loving. Even though we knew it wasn’t meant to last, I am still grateful for the time we spent together. — Julie Vaughn, Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Julie Vaughn, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"
440,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,Two Astronomy Nerds,"It was supermoon night, the kind astronomy nerds long for. I had an exam the next day and my nose in a biology textbook when this strawberry blonde girl asked if anyone knew how to get to the observatory. It’s a through-the-woods kind of thing, but I did, in fact, know how to get there. We hiked with phone flashlights along two trails to the top of the hill. Looking at our moonlit shadows, we sat silent. Heading back, we got lost, and I traded a leaf for her number. — Ethan Bradley, Kenyon College","Ethan Bradley, Kenyon College"
441,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,"“Back Then, I Was a Straight Girl”","Remember how we met, as semi-random roommates? Back then, I was a straight girl. You were a Christian with a boyfriend. You held me during my late-night panic attacks. I annoyed you into going to class. Remember how we dated for a month? Sometimes I forget that we’re technically exes. And then the crisis: Too many friends died. Too much anti-queer turmoil on campus. I came out as a guy. You said you would only date women. We supported each other and survived. You’re my platonic soulmate. Now we have an apartment and two cats. — Elliot Eason, Georgia Institute of Technology","Elliot Eason, Georgia Institute of Technology"
442,2019-05-07T19:00:01+0000,Everybody Loves Via,"I met Julia in my fraternity’s basement after a wedding-themed party. We spent 10 weeks pretending we weren’t in love, steeling ourselves for a 6-month study-abroad separation. Reunited, we went out for awkward catch-up drinks and dinner. The night melted into a surprising familiarity. Outside her place, my Via ride-share car on the way, she said, “I love Via.” Mishearing, I blurted, “I love you, too.” She said, “It has the best algorithms!” I froze. Two years later, she kissed me and said, “I love you.” I smiled and said, “I love Via, too.” — Danny Gridley, Dartmouth College","Danny Gridley, Dartmouth College"
443,2019-04-30T19:00:01+0000,No Joke,"We are both named Phoebe. This means our path to love has been littered with disbelief, laughter and confusion. It was hard enough coming out in a lesbian relationship in our late 20s, but a relationship between two people with the same name? People say, “You’re joking, right?” But it’s no joke that when we moved the fridge during our kitchen renovation, she saw my rainbow writing on the wall, asking her to marry me. And it’s no joke that she said yes. And I’m not joking when I say that my life is very nearly perfect now. — Phoebe Wallner",Phoebe Wallner

Blood transfusions. Liver blood clot. Rare. I wasn’t ready to meet my baby girl. I searched for clues in the nurse’s eyes, asking her, “Am I going to die? Will I be able to be her mother?” My baby lived. I almost didn’t. Weeks followed where I couldn’t hold Ruby. I was too weak. Wasn’t ready. Didn’t want to. Then one day that tiny girl gave me a half smile. I knew we were going to be O.K. — Stefanie Torres",Stefanie Torres

I have two 20-something sons, but Mike is not one of them. I can’t say that I’ve taken it well — or accepted it without a struggle. Botox has softened my lines, though my outlook has softened, too. Now, at 56, I see my husband's thick hair, slim physique and smooth skin as a bonus of being his partner. It makes me feel desirable. Thirty-two years ago, we chose each other. We choose each other still. — Jane Marion",Jane Marion
446,2019-04-30T19:00:01+0000,Breaking Up In a Small Town,"Breaking up in a small mountain town is hard. I still crane my neck after every white truck, searching the bed for your scratched black toolbox and the ghosts of us intertwined there, sleeping under younger stars. One day we may have children, but not together. And those children — mine, yours, but not ours — may grow up in the valley where we fell in love. They may even ski after school together. I’ll smile at your new truck across the ski hill parking lot. Your long auburn hair will be shorter and grayer, but you’ll still wear a mustache, and you’ll smile back. — Michelle DeLong",Michelle DeLong
447,2019-04-30T19:00:01+0000,We Ate Nothing But Onions,"Recently, I stood over the stove caramelizing onions. The smell suddenly reminded me of that summer we spent cooped up in our tiny dark apartment. Hiding from the heat in the day and caramelizing onions in the evening. Excited by the aroma, our feet stuck to linoleum, we came alive as the sun went down, our bellies growling for a taste. I had forgotten it was all we ate — for weeks, caramelized onions — because it was all we could afford. My memories of that time are sweet, sticky and content. Almost buried by layers of time. — Megan Bolaños",Megan Bolaños
448,2019-04-23T19:00:04+0000,Salami in the Closet,"When we met, he was studying psychology. On our first date, we split a mushroom flatbread — my choice, because I’m a vegetarian. After three months, we moved in together and he started doing all the cooking. A few years and many vegetables later, he began curing his own meats. In a New York City apartment, this meant salami hanging next to my winter coat. He started interning at a butcher shop and soon left psychology behind. I’m a vegetarian marrying a butcher this summer. That’s our idea of true love. — Shannon Cleary",Shannon Cleary
449,2019-04-23T19:00:04+0000,Twirling Until I Am Dizzy and Happy,"At the Starbucks on Wilshire Boulevard, one glance is all it took for us to decide to forgo the requisite coffee and instead walk half a mile to LACMA. It was there, in a curved chamber within the massive Richard Serra “Band” (a 13-foot-tall undulating ribbon of steel) that I — at age 63 — suddenly had the impulse to twirl. He had the impulse to set his camera on video. Almost a decade later, we watch and laugh as I spin and then stagger toward him, dizzy and happy. — Barbara Buckles",Barbara Buckles
450,2019-04-23T19:00:04+0000,The Tiniest Gas Station Man,"Adopting after 18 years of marriage is no Gap ad. Seeing my neighbors head out to dinner gives me a juvenile left-out feeling. As I head down the hallway to grab my book, I hear a babbling sound coming from my son’s room. Opening the door, I am greeted by a tiny, uncorrupted smile. I pick him up. He slides his little starfish hand down the back of my shirt for security, and there it rests, warm and powerfully attached, as if he is the gas station man filling me up with love. — Vicky Bates",Vicky Bates
451,2019-04-23T19:00:04+0000,Glad I Wore My Pink Tennis Shoes,"When we met in music theory class, he said he liked my pink tennis shoes. “Thanks,” I said. “I wear them so people think I’m athletic!” Shortly after, his roommate died in an accident on the Oregon coast. The year before, I had lost my boyfriend in a car crash. I knew what to do. I brought chili and cornbread. I listened. We became friends, roommates, best friends and then, for me, more. “I’m going to cut to the chase,” I said. “We can’t live together. I have a huge crush on you.” He smiled. It’s been 2.5 years of joy. — Chloe Smithson",Chloe Smithson

We were instantly infatuated. When I had to leave for a family dinner, our mutual disappointment was palpable. In a clumsy attempt to woo me, he emptied his pockets into my hands: some change, a charm, a couple of button graphics (everything but his used gum wrapper). I felt simultaneously embarrassed and elated. We lasted three days, teased mercilessly by our siblings, before he publicly called me his “baby.” And. I. Was. So. Over. It. — Lindy Hargrave",Lindy Hargrave

Seeing my distress, he whipped his hand under my nose to catch the explosion. We were both disgusted. “I just needed you to take my coffee,” I said. “Oh,” he said. “I wish I’d thought of that.” No longer the early days, now there’s a baby on the way. I’m happy I’ve found someone who’s willing to get his hands dirty. — Yasmin Sabir",Yasmin Sabir

My body had healed but my mind was still at war. Italy charmed me like a lover I hadn’t expected to meet. Rome courted me on cobblestone streets. Capri caressed me with its sea. Florence spoon-fed me gelato. In a country far away, my body finally began to feel like home. I had saved my life, but Italy taught me how to savor it. — Stephanie Kennedy",Stephanie Kennedy

When you’re young, you fight over children or money, but sex cures everything, and the future is far away. As you age, you fight over truly listening to each other, and the future has parked in your driveway. You take advantage, but you also learn to treasure each other while you’re both still here.

It was the hardest thing I had ever tried to do: flirt before coffee. Usually I mumbled something unintelligible about working late or my car getting towed. One morning, I noticed her name tag and said, “Hi, Anu,” mispronouncing her name. Luckily, there was a banana sticker on my shirt. “I'm Chiquita,” I said.

At a difficult time, a friend asked me what I needed, and I said, “Mercy.” Five days later, I found myself at dinner with a stranger while traveling. When he learned about my name change, he said, “I gave myself a new last name, too, after hearing my grandmother pray for traveling mercies.” That connection proved uncommon in a way I never could have imagined. His last name was Mercy. — Karen Faith",Karen Faith
461,2019-04-09T19:00:07+0000,In Harmony,"The salty taste of arroz con gandules, carne vieja and a slice of cold aguacate. The daytime soap opera plays in the background as I wait for mami to leave work and get me. My grandma sings hymns softly while my grandpa looks out the window. A chorus of bird songs accompany Grandma’s melody. A toddler, I sit on the chilly tile floor, preferring this to the sofa with the plastic. Grandpa was always so quiet; Grandma was loud and commanding. They were perfectly in harmony as they rocked in their chairs, and I daydreamed and loved them. — Tashay Gonzalez",Tashay Gonzalez
462,2019-04-09T19:00:07+0000,"“Tell Me, Honey”","I have worshiped my older brother my entire life. We are in our 50s now. Last summer he fell ill, gripped by mania, his extraordinary mind betraying him, fueling a paranoia that his wife and I were working against him. I wept constantly, wracked with worry. I was desperate to talk about it — once a day, or 27 times — for months. Before his difficult recovery, whenever I would begin a sentence, “My brother …” my husband of two decades would put down his phone, coffee, newspaper or briefcase and look into my eyes and say, “Tell me, honey.” — Sarah Brazaitis",Sarah Brazaitis
463,2019-04-02T19:53:45+0000,Watching Other People Fall for My Boy,"I fell in love with a boy when I was only 18. Both of us were raised in conservative Christian households, and we said “I do” at 20. Twelve years and two children later, we’re still in love. But I kept falling in love with other people, too. So now we’re polyamorous. I have a boyfriend. He has a girlfriend. And we share a relationship with another woman. I enjoy it, but what I think I like most is watching other people fall in love with the same boy I fell for years ago. It’s like, “Yeah, you get it, right?” — Jennifer Martin",Jennifer Martin
464,2019-04-02T19:53:45+0000,"We Couldn’t Marry, So She Married a Guy","As we sat close together at a cafe, I asked her if she was sure. We had been lovers for five years and friends for 10. “My wedding is in two days,” she replied. “I hope you can make it.” Then she said, “Had you been a guy, we would have two kids by now. Also, married.” I smiled, she smiled back, her expression spelling regret. We were two Filipino women without the right to wed. — April Casquejo",April Casquejo
465,2019-04-02T19:53:45+0000,Our Sisterhood Marathon,"My sister was waiting for me at the finish of the Chicago Marathon, though she’d crossed it hours before. I ran, demoralized, as the service vehicles bringing up the rear passed me. I ran, unsure how far I had to go, as the mile markers were taken down. My sister never texted: “What’s taking so long?” She waited just past the race archway. We burst into tears when I made it. “I got your medal,” she said, slipping it over my head. The photographers were already gone. — Grace Hussar",Grace Hussar
466,2019-04-02T19:53:45+0000,She Shushed the Audience for Me,"It was during a lull in my writing life, six months of no publications and constant moping, when she said, “Look, I don’t want to hear about this writing stuff anymore until you can make a living at it, O.K.? I just don’t.” She wanted substance, a child, maybe a ring. Yet she still accompanied me to every reading at every dive bar, independent bookstore and trendy Brooklyn art space. And when I delayed a club’s burlesque night with my 18-page opus, there she was, telling the audience to shut their traps, one nattering hipster at a time. — J.B. McGeever",J.B. McGeever
467,2019-04-02T19:53:45+0000,"“After 48 Hours, It’s Time to Move On”","My husband of 31 years died early one January morning from injuries sustained in a fall at home. Two days later, I received an email from a dating service for those over 50. The subject line asked, “Are you ready to try love again?” I burst out laughing. It must be a coincidence. Or are all the computers trading information? Maybe the consensus on the internet is that after 48 hours, it’s time to move on. When I stopped laughing, I thought, “I’ve got to tell Tom. He’ll think it’s hilarious.” Oh. I do that a lot these days. — Nora Raum",Nora Raum
468,2019-03-26T19:44:25+0000,A Long To-Do List,"The night you were discharged from the clinic where we had been both patient and prisoner, you tried to throw yourself into blinding headlights. Days later, I visited you in a new white room. You showed me a list of things you wanted to do. It was long, and I was relieved. You had written, “Kiss Greta,” and I looked at you, surprised. That’s when you checked off the first thing on that list, and I thought of time, how ours had intersected to produce an unpredictable bond and a happiness that we had missed for so long. — Greta Kerr",Greta Kerr
469,2019-03-26T19:44:25+0000,When We Became One,"We grew up in even numbers. Two parents, four sons, six people. Two boys per bedroom. Summers with two of us at one of our grandparents’ houses and two at the other, then a switch. Always disciplined, referred to and taught about the facts of life in pairs. Then, in middle age, Kurt called me to say that Greg, the youngest, had unexpectedly died, and I called Chris to tell him the same. Chris and I flew home and Kurt met us at the airport. We held each other and, in that moment, four became three became one. — Brian Justice",Brian Justice

Cleaning up — and it struck me: Would he be able to tolerate the spice? I grew up immersed in spice. In his Romanian family, even a little ginger was spicy. Could I be with someone long-term who was on a different “spice scale”? He sat, oblivious to my dread. Dipped spoon, brought to lips. I held my breath. “It’s delicious,” he said. “I especially love the spice.” And that’s when I knew he was the one. — Isha Antani",Isha Antani

472,2019-03-26T19:44:25+0000,From Ski Break to Full Break,"That ski break was supposed to be the cinematic week we finally got together after 20 years in the friend zone. Only he hadn’t read the script. I should have realized when he invited someone else and asked, “Do you still want to come?” Or when I was injured and left alone as they got drunk. I finally faced the truth as the three of us sat on the couch watching television with them entwined. I left the next morning, taking a taxi down the mountain. They married two years later with a ski-themed cake. Tasteful. — Juliet Telford",Juliet Telford

I joined Denis’s fraternity to be his brother but fell for him instead. He nicknamed us “Romes and Jules” after the Zeffirelli movie. Even though I dumped him for the visiting art professor, he dropped everything to drive me home when my 45-year-old mother lay dying of alcoholism. It was an act of lovingkindness unlike anything I have ever known. Husbands have come and gone, but our 50-year friendship lives on. — Lynn Lobban",Lynn Lobban
474,2019-03-19T19:00:04+0000,Burnt Honey,"We graduated from the same culinary school but met working together at food events. I developed new food products that she styled in photo shoots. For more than 10 years, I ignored my feelings for this beautiful woman: so smart, funny, talented and — married. One night at a cookbook launch party, we stood in a dark studio in Austin, Tex. She told me about her favorite new dish, wings coated with burnt honey. She described it and touched my arm. My vision tunneled. Nothing I could do. Remembering that moment a month later, I recreated the dish. It was delicious. — John Bartel",John Bartel

Nobody will know it but you. There was pain in my relationship with my boyfriend of eight years, but I had ignored it. I finally understood the true meaning of my mother’s saying when he cheated on me. I don’t hate him or the other woman anymore. I took off the shoes and am free. — Karleen Chiu",Karleen Chiu

I spent three powerful days with him, shadows looming. On my final night, my brother and I went to dinner, our last together. Small talk with interludes of silence, just staring at one another. Declaring our love with words seemed feeble. He was everything a big brother should be to a little sister. Is knowing that it would be the last time together a gift? I think so. Love you, Bob. Miss you big time. — Chris Teicheira",Chris Teicheira
477,2019-03-19T19:00:04+0000,I’ll Park for You,"For couples who park their cars on the street, dealing with alternate-side regulations is the worst. It’s cold, crackling cold. Today, I insist I will do this for my husband after his hip replacement. I grab my travel mug of hot coffee, his comforting parka, my satchel of magazines, my phone. I pray that the street sweeper will bypass our block. It does. After 90 minutes, I climb back into our cozy bed beside my husband, who murmurs, “Thank you.” Because we both know that sharing city chores is an expression of true love. — Judy Hadlock",Judy Hadlock
478,2019-03-12T19:00:05+0000,Up in the Air,"Both flight attendants, we met while working a flight to Seattle, Laura’s home city. She told me I made her sweat, paying attention to her like she was a first-class passenger, but I said it was just the polyester uniform. On our layover, we drank wine and ate Thai food. I spent the night at her house instead of my airport hotel room. Seven years later, we married. Now, when we find ourselves on the same flight, we sometimes pretend we are strangers meeting for the first time, just to keep things fresh. She says I still make her sweat. — Dawn Grace",Dawn Grace

I enter, wait, then pass through three doors. A 9/11 mural says “Never Forget,” and I know I never will. My husband, in blue scrubs, picks up the telephone, and our hands press against the glass divider. I force a smile; he does too. Next to us, another man meets his newborn child for the first time, through glass. I wear Andi’s jacket because it smells like him. Three months later, he is deported, his asylum case lost. — Kristina Karin Shull",Kristina Karin Shull

My other friend, Alice, said, “Don’t waste your time with these dating sites.” Online, not much activity. I wrote to some men; some men wrote to me. Then a man, a professor my age, married 44 years until his wife died, asked me out. I, also a professor, widowed after 36 years, said O.K. to coffee. Turns out he lives two blocks away. Now, the bed is crowded: his wife, my husband, us. It’s kind of cozy. — Nan Bauer-Maglin",Nan Bauer-Maglin
481,2019-03-12T19:00:05+0000,Best Investment Ever,"I once purchased a penny with a heart cut into it at a New Jersey rest stop. Before going on summer break my sophomore year of college, I gave it to this guy I was hanging out with and made a joke about not spending it all in one place. Twenty years later, using my husband’s car while he’s in Florida for our son’s baseball tournament, I discover that penny on his key ring.

We rode to the A&W and sat on a bench under the egg-yolk-yellow lights with root beer floats: the orange awning flapping, the moonlit sky, the future, childhood that would last a lifetime, the smell of work in your shirt, me, the prince of your moment, and you, the king in your Uniroyal jacket. — Theodore Groves",Theodore Groves
483,2019-03-05T20:00:47+0000,Holding on as Venezuela Falls Apart,"Like millions of others, we have been forced to leave our land and homes, everything we knew, owned and loved, as Venezuela falls apart. Scattered in four cities in three countries, my family has stayed together through video calls with good-mornings and nightly blessings. That wasn’t enough for my mother, who, while still in Venezuela with my father, fell sick, dropping to 95 pounds. We thought it was gastrointestinal, but it was fear and sadness: Would we ever be together again? When my sister’s family joined my brother’s in Maui, something sparked. Instant joy from this picture fueled her recovery. — Jesus Yajure",Jesus Yajure

But 34 years on, it’s gaping again. We know we won’t finish this story together. I creak a little; he creaks more. Yet we’re still riding the same wave of passion that we always have: argument, travel, art, a shared table. We will crash with happiness; we refuse to end with a whimper. — Gayle Austen",Gayle Austen
485,2019-03-05T20:00:47+0000,Enough Time to Tee Off,"We thought we heard a flicker of a heartbeat, but it was gone now. Our doctor stared at the screen for an eternity before advising us to evacuate the now nonviable pregnancy. We were to come back in three hours. What to do with the last three hours of my pregnancy? My husband took me to the nearby driving range. With each swing, we hit out our frustration and pain. At 2 p.m. my husband held my hand and stroked my hair as our baby left my body. I had never felt more loved by him than in that moment. — Amanda Lockwood",Amanda Lockwood

Our first FaceTime conversation lasted five hours. God, family, gayness, politics, children — we talked about it all. Not a typical conversation between two Korean men. When I landed in Incheon, he was waiting at the airport. A perfect summer together, our first relationship. Nearly two years later, we’re still apart — he in Seoul, I in Changshu — but still together. #modernromance is #real. Get swiping, kids. — Sam Jeong",Sam Jeong

I was trying to get into his head to discourage him from applying for the space, but he thought I was flirting. Fifteen minutes later, when I turned in my application, the landlord thought we were looking for an apartment together. “No, we just met!” I said. “I don't know this guy.” “That's too bad,” she replied. ”You’d make a great couple.” I got the apartment; he got my number.

Back in Sydney, I told my 85-year-old grandmother I wanted to send him photos of native birds. Weeks later, I received a voice mail message from her, saying, “I took my first photo! It’s a cockatoo for you to send to that boy you like in New York.” It was blurry, and his response wasn’t game-changing, but I’ll always remember that my grandmother learned how to use an iPhone just so she could help me impress a bloke overseas.

Born and raised in Sydney’s inner city, I had no dust on my boots or dirt under my nails. “You drive a Ute?” her grandfather asked me, referring to a utility vehicle. “Absolutely,” I lied. When I crashed through the back of their garage, I figured we were over. At least it’ll make a good story: “I used to date this girl until her grandfather killed me.” He ran over, unleashing an impressive torrent of curse words. Then I saw her doubled over laughing and knew everything would be OK. — Thomas Mitchell",Thomas Mitchell
490,2019-02-26T21:28:35+0000,The Dress I Can’t Throw Away,"When I was 15, I bought a white dress at a store called “Tree of Life.” I told my best friend that one day I would marry her in it. We laughed, which hurt me, though I couldn’t figure out why. Eventually, I worked it out and told her the truth: None of it had ever been a joke. In the same sentence, she told me she loved me but we could never happen — girls didn’t marry other girls. In 2017, when marriage equality passed in Australia, she was the first person I thought of, my first great love. I’ve kept the white dress. I don’t think I could ever throw it away. — Eleanor Gerrard",Eleanor Gerrard

(Two trips before, my dearest had mistakenly ticked all the “yes” boxes on the immigration card. Tuberculosis: yes. Biological specimens: yes. Firearms: yes. Illicit drugs: yes. “Mate,” sighed the immigration officer. “The fellow before you only spoke German and he got it right.”) I worked my jet-lagged child’s foot into a sneaker, wondering how it came to pass that I am saddled with such a travel partner.

492,2019-02-26T21:28:35+0000,Wedding Apocalypse,"A December wedding planned to a tee. Flowering Eucalyptus gums dripped with pink and orange. Cicadas roared. The menu was Thai, the wine organic, the air so humid my earrings slipped off my lobes. We shot photos by the Hawkesbury River as the storm rolled in, drawing closer with each shutter snap. Guests turned to look, then edged toward the barn. Dark rain on the water, lightning on the bank. “Time to bail,” said our photographer, hopping down the hill. “This is the best apocalypse I’ve ever attended,” said a friend, soaked, pulling the barn door shut with a screech. — Sophie McComas",Sophie McComas

Tipsy, she moaned longingly at my McFlurry. I asked if she wanted some. She did. We flirted as the passenger in the front seat was dropped off. She asked the driver if she should get out with me. The driver said we lived near each other. We kissed to make sure it was worth it. It was. Eight months later, we can’t get Uber to sponsor our love. Uber? McDonalds? Are you there?

Just as Penelope wove a never-ending shroud while she waited for her soldier to come home, I developed a new and sudden obsession with knitting, winding yarn around needles to make him an endless stream of impractical and unwanted accessories — scarves, gloves, even a camouflage hat (with pom-poms). Powerless to protect him, I turned the rows of stitches into my rosary: “Come back, come back, come back.” Once he was home I put down my needles, permanently. — Kate Sturla",Kate Sturla

When the D.J. played “Low” by Flo Rida, I dropped it so low that I split my pants. We went to the women’s bathroom to survey the damage. It was pretty bad. She could see my whole butt, especially when I tried out some dance moves. She’d never worn a thong before, but the situation was dire. So we swapped. I pulled on her full-coverage underwear, she slid on my thong, and we headed back out to dance. — Jessica Hackel",Jessica Hackel

My previously married ex-husband, John, was leftover Chinese food: so compelling in the refrigerator, but you were always sorry after you ate it. Vinnie, pizza-maker and “transition man,” was a banquet verging on bacchanal: destined to create heartburn but impossible to stop eating.

When he ordered only water to drink while I enjoyed a few beers, I prodded. With neither hesitation nor shame, he laid out his demons: four years in recovery from heroin and alcohol addiction. Then I laid out mine: 10 years recovering from eating disorders. Within 15 minutes, we knew all of each other’s ugly parts. We’ve spent the rest of our time together discovering the beautiful ones. — Ally Petrilla",Ally Petrilla

It had taken guts to call off my engagement, and that’s exactly what it cost me. “Your colon has to come out,” the doctors said. I wanted to tell them to take my heart too. Two weeks after I discovered my fiancé’s secret addiction, stress worsened my colitis to the point that I needed emergency surgery. My parents slept upright in plastic chairs next to my hospital bed. Mom’s hand moved over mine, and Dad’s body slumped toward the monitor. This is love, this is love, went my heart. — Bethany Sales",Bethany Sales

Teddy, with red bow tie, was found in store window marked “Not for Sale.” A sad man made generous offer to the store owner, who said, “Yes.” In my office, a man carrying a bear walks in, hands me a Valentine that says: “We cannot bear a future without you.

At 51, he discovered that he had Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a monstrous, degenerative brain disorder. Within a week, Jon lost the ability to move his limbs and speak. But on Valentine’s Day he was still able to hold my hand and form his lips into a kiss.

Every time we spoke, Greg said, “Happy Valentine’s Day!” By the third time, I started smiling.

When we were first married I needed to hear the words, but I got used to looking for other signs of his love, such as him cooking my favorite Thai dishes. Twenty years married, we were sitting at a sushi bar waiting for our food when he turned to me and said, “I love you.” Shocked, I said, “Who are you sleeping with?” This November we’ll be married 50 years.

Before long, she was the small hand in mine as we crossed the street, the smile to prove she had brushed her teeth and the curious voice whispering until we fell asleep. It began to feel as if she were mine. Now, six months after the split with her mother, I realize she was not mine. But I loved her. — Nicole DeMouth",Nicole DeMouth

Then I met Bert. The exes would have called him “just” a cop. Hellishly good-looking, irrevocably calm and a quiet observer who missed nothing, he was smarter but didn’t need anyone to know it. With so little for him to prove, our income differential was like a height variation: inconsequential when lying down. Thirty years and two children later we’re still the right amount of same, the right amount of different. — Gillian Parson",was
507,2019-02-05T20:26:58+0000,A Rhyming Love Poem,"Friends since childhood with a little crush, until one fall evening when it became too much. A lingering hug led to a kiss — that turned into passion, compounded by bliss. For 35 years we ignored each other (I a procurement agent, she a mother). But as you can tell from our humble pic, you want a love story, this is it! So consider my poem from beginning to end: “The Story of Clay and Rosalind.” — Clay Luckett",Clay Luckett
508,2019-01-29T20:10:11+0000,What I Have Now,"Things I used to have: A tidy resume. Unfettered relationships. Nice hair. A paycheck. An almost complete disregard for anyone besides myself. A fully intact perineum. Steadfast opinions on child rearing. A self-regulating internal body temperature. A vague disdain for that mother who would “work from home” on Fridays even though our office did not have an established work-from-home-on-Fridays policy. An unwavering reverence for that old chestnut of the capitalist patriarchy, “I can have it all!” The slightest idea of who I am, or who I will become. Things I have now: A baby. — Lesley Foster",can
509,2019-01-29T20:10:11+0000,Waiting for Frieda,"After everyone had gone to bed, my 96-year-old Aunt Frieda would slip on her red, high-heel slippers, peek out of her nursing home door and run naked to her beloved Shottsy, a fellow resident. In her mind he was my Uncle Joe, her husband who died 30 years before. Shottsy would expect my aunt’s visits, lying under his covers in anticipation. One night Aunt Frieda surprised him. Shottsy shrieked when she arrived. Aunt Frieda had the cake frosting from her dinner tray spread across her breasts. The nursing home called me with concern. Aunt Frieda insisted it was their anniversary. — Maya Balle",Maya Balle
510,2019-01-29T20:10:11+0000,“Love Is My Husband Rubbing My Mother’s Feet”,"The most grueling, rewarding and loving act you can perform is to help keep someone alive. When I found the love of my life, he immediately signed up for this journey. We knew we would do everything we could to care for my mother and, eventually, we would watch her die. For us, love isn’t chocolates and date nights and expensive trips. Love is my husband rubbing my mother’s feet after her bath, making her laugh as he pretends she is kicking him in the stomach, helping her take her medicine and holding me after she was gone. — Jessica McLean",Jessica McLean
511,2019-01-29T20:10:11+0000,“A Breakfast Betrayed”,"We had been married just a few weeks. I used up the last of the milk one morning and left for work while my husband was still in the shower. I returned that evening to find an art installation on the table, labeled in neat handwriting on a folded-over notecard: “A Breakfast Betrayed. 1993. Wheat on ceramic.” Next to it was the bowl of cereal my husband had poured for himself — sitting milkless. For more than 25 years, we have continued to treat domestic annoyances with humor. Our love has lasted; but even better, so has the fun. — Mary Janevic",Mary Janevic
512,2019-01-29T20:10:11+0000,"New Announcement, New Name, Still Ours","When you were born, we sent announcements — name, weight, date — engraved on thick white cards with pale pink stripes and polka dots. “It’s a girl,” we said. We were thrilled. Now, 16 years later, so much is new. The pink was wrong. The name was too. This time, we know. It’s a boy. There will be no pastel stationery. This time, we are telling everyone, face to face. He’s ours. — Maria Blackburn",Maria Blackburn
513,2019-01-22T20:30:01+0000,Roller Derby Romance,"I was a single mother working a full-time day job and helping run my roller derby league. I did not trust men, especially in the mostly female space I had co-founded, which was keeping me going after a trying divorce. But Hal was genuine and kind to everyone, and made no demands. He went from fan to volunteer to friend to lover to guy who dropped his entire life to drive me to Missouri to care for my dying mother. I realized I’d be an idiot not to spend the rest of my life with him. — Amy Callner",Amy Callner
514,2019-01-22T20:30:01+0000,Can I Take Your Picture?,"When the days are so long and you finally get to the weekend and realize it’s been months since you have been out with your partner without your little one too (beloved though she is), a stranger asks, “Hey, when is the last time you took a photo together?” You smile because you can’t remember when the last time was, and you do find him pretty cute even if you two fight sometimes and say things you shouldn’t. The camera flashes, and you come back to each other and to the fact that love doesn’t fail even when you do. — Fantasia Norse",— Fantasia Norse
515,2019-01-22T20:30:01+0000,"“I Gout You, Babe”","The relationship had one big hurdle: my drinking. Alcohol was my evening crutch, and if that meant passing out by 8 p.m. every night, then so be it. But she stuck with me. Why, I don’t really know. Finally, one day, intense foot pain arose. “It’s gout,” said the doctor. “No more beer — try water instead.” The drinking subsided, the relationship soared and bad puns filled in where the booze had been. “I really like the footing on which we find ourselves,” I’d say via text, to which she’d reply, “I gout you, babe.” — Josh Lefkowitz",Josh Lefkowitz
516,2019-01-22T20:30:01+0000,"Traveling 6,584 Miles to Meet Me","When I was young and had trouble sleeping, I would ask my mother to tell me the story of how she and my father traveled 6,584 miles to meet me at an orphanage in Hefei, China. I used to think the adoption process was easy, until years later when I went into our family’s safe and found the detailed essays that my mother and father had written explaining why they wanted to become parents. These documents remind me that our family is connected not by blood but by my parents’ love and their determination to make our family whole. — Lucy Sears",Lucy Sears
517,2019-01-22T20:30:01+0000,I Love a Man With an Anchor Tattoo,"Before leaving my studio apartment in Queens, I emailed my friends: “When I come back from Maine, I’ll bring home a lobsterman with an anchor tattoo.” I was joking, but then I spotted him — head to toe in yellow oilskins (just like a guy on a frozen fish box), climbing off his vintage Honda motorcycle. I turned to my girlfriends and immediately called dibs. Now, when he gets home from a day of fishing, our son runs into his arms, the right one tattooed with an anchor. — Laura Serino",Laura Serino
518,2019-01-15T20:00:01+0000,Most Important Photo Ever,"Neither of us wanted to be at our high school reunion. I was worried I would have to retell the story of my high school sweetheart’s death to pancreatic cancer over and over. He was recently separated after years of being in an unhappy marriage. We didn’t know each other in high school, but 30 years later there we were, two lonely souls circling each other in a crowded room for hours until he took a photograph of me. We talked for two minutes, and it turned into a second lifetime. “The most important photo I’ve ever taken,” he said. — Stacey Paterson-Korynkiewicz",Stacey Paterson-Korynkiewicz

Girl and girl remain madly in love years later. — Ash Kline",Ash Kline

My cerebral palsy brother boy. The happiest, cheekiest, most squirmy child ever to exist. Now 13, he brightens a room with his smile. His robotic slurs are laced with sarcasm, and a quick wit belies his youth. We argue about who loves “Scooby-Doo” more, dance while he’s in his wheelchair, share treats. “I love you,” he says, and then: “Just kidding.” What a tease. — Cierra Waters",Cierra Waters
521,2019-01-15T20:00:01+0000,Luckily There Was No Facilitator,"It was 2000. I was a sad, middle-aged social worker nervously attending a divorce support group at an Episcopal Church in Atlanta. Only one other person was there, a man my age, talkative. We purged our agony for hours and I thought, “Geez, this facilitator is so self-disclosing.” Then he said, “How long have you been running this group?” The real leader never came that day we shared our heartache and felt the first frisson of love. We laughed all the way to the parking lot and never went back to the group. — Moira Keller",Moira Keller
522,2019-01-15T20:00:01+0000,The Folly of Date Night,"Date night! Tonight we are free! No bottoms to wipe or mouths to feed; it’s just you and me. “We should go out,” I say. “Run naked in the rain, make love on a train or something?” But we don’t. Instead, we look at pictures of the children on our phones until we fall asleep. — Emily Jane-Clark",Emily Jane-Clark
523,2019-01-08T16:41:23+0000,After the Fire,"My whole hand used to fit in my mother’s palm. When I was sad and scared, she would squeeze me tight and say it’s all going to be all right. Now I’m 24. My parents lost everything in Northern California’s Tubbs Fire in October 2017. Both surgeons, they are strong and brave, but sometimes wake up at night in their temporary home with nightmares of the recent deadly fires. I can’t bring back their treasures or take away their stress, but I can tell them I love them and hold my mother’s hand like she once held mine. — Siena Canales",Siena Canales
524,2019-01-08T16:41:23+0000,“You Can’t Escape Heartbreak or Capitalism”,"We had broken up outside of Cold Stone Creamery, and now we were in Target, where my puffy eyes turned to the Valentine’s Day cards. It was Jan. 7, and the breakup felt just as premature as the heart-covered greetings. He nudged me and pointed them out: “Too soon?” I choked out a polite laugh. There is something funny about ending almost three years together in a strip mall in the middle of suburbia. No matter how hard you try, you can’t escape heartbreak or capitalism. — Katrina Schmidt",Katrina Schmidt
525,2019-01-08T16:41:23+0000,Hostile New World,"He popped up. Ten miles away. GPS for sex. Ricardo was visiting Los Angeles from San Diego, the thrum of a music festival pumping through his veins. When I saw him, my heart jumped into my throat, trying to make its way out of my eyes — tears of joy. Now, three years later, we are navigating this increasingly hostile new world, holding hands. Just two queer Latino men finding all the sweetness life has hidden from us. Tying our hearts together to defeat the darkness, like Pablo Neruda did with his Matilde. — Edwin Alexis Gómez",Edwin Alexis Gómez
526,2019-01-08T16:41:23+0000,Phil and Phillip,"My son, Phil, and I came back to New York City from Seattle for the holidays. We rode from Manhattan to Brooklyn in a crowded subway car. A stranger was kind enough to let my child sit. Phil asked his grandpa, Phillip, to sit, and then fell asleep on him. No other seats became available during our hourlong ride. My father has Parkinson’s disease. He struggled but held my son tightly. As we exited the train, his arms shook with fatigue. Decades ago, that same man used to rock me to sleep on packed trains. Those rides were magical to a child. — Kat Lieu",Kat Lieu
527,2019-01-08T16:41:23+0000,Now It’s All Fresh Fish,"We are grandparents. The age when most couples stay put. “We need something new,” I said as our Trader Joe’s fish defrosted in our suburban Maryland kitchen. “Why not sell the house? We’re retired and the kids are settled. And you know it’s been my dream to live abroad while we still can.” My dream, not his. He looked at me, his face inscrutable. Three years, two funerals and two weddings later, we still eat fish for dinner. But it’s caught in Clew Bay, near our home in the shadow of Croagh Patrick. We’re old, we’re new, we’re together, in Ireland. — Roberta Beary",Roberta Beary
528,2019-01-01T20:00:01+0000,"Those Who Diet Together, Stay Together","I wanted a date for New Year’s Eve, so I posted on a dating forum. In my bio, I said I’m a big lady so don’t message me if you can’t handle a real woman. Of the people who replied, one said, “I’m willing to go on a diet with you.” We met in November, dated in December and had our New Year’s date. Four years later, on the eve of the new millennium, we got married. After 18 years together, we are both still dieting but happily in love. — Jane Sattler",Jane Sattler

Post-scare, I remember telling my sister about the stressful ordeal. Incredulous, she chided, “Neither of you confessed your undying love? That tells you everything about the state of your ‘relationship.’” Yes, we’ve never said, “I love you.” But he did think of me when he thought a missile was coming. — Gabriella Etoniru",Gabriella Etoniru
530,2019-01-01T20:00:01+0000,Party of Two,"We moved to New Jersey from Ohio on Jan. 1. A year later, we still had no friends, no invitations for New Year’s Eve. That afternoon, Eli barreled down the stairs to announce that we were having a party. “With who?” I asked. “With each other,” he said. I wore sequins. We danced, played Jenga, wrote predictions and sealed them in an envelope. We left a note in the neighbor’s mailbox saying we liked their Christmas lights. We drank champagne, threw a ball back and forth 200 times, talked with British accents, and, at midnight, we kissed. — Monique Bernstein",Monique Bernstein
531,2019-01-01T20:00:01+0000,“Rushing for a Knife Could Be Alarming”,"For Christmas, I gave him an expensive chef’s knife. It was better than mine, even though I am the more enthusiastic cook. Right after New Year’s, standing in his beige, Burbank living room, he broke up with me without explanation. As I cried and screamed, I thought about the knife in the next room and considered retrieving it. He didn’t deserve that knife. I also knew, in that moment, rushing for a knife could be alarming in a get-you-arrested kind of way. So I didn’t get it. But I still think about that damn knife every day. — Shannon Latimer",Shannon Latimer
532,2019-01-01T20:00:01+0000,Our Gratitude Jar,"We’re supposed to open the jar on New Year’s Day, hung over in our pajamas, reading the little notes of gratitude we had written to each other throughout the year. But I haven’t been able to wait. Every time I saw him pause during a happy evening to write down a memory in his delicate script, I unscrewed the jar, pulled out the Post-it (despite his halfhearted protest) and smiled as I read his words: gratitude for our health, our home, our family, our dog, our friendship and love. Why wait to remind ourselves how good life is together? — Colleen Goodhue",Colleen Goodhue
533,2018-12-25T20:00:01+0000,Seeing Him in the Chili Pepper Lights,"It’s that time again. How do I know? Because of that old string of red chili pepper lights from Albuquerque. We bought them more than 30 years ago for our first Christmas together, yet every one of those chilies still lights up when I plug them in. He’s been gone six years now. Our love died before he did, at least officially, according to the divorce decree. But every Christmas, just like the red chili peppers, my heart glows red and I remember him. — Marla West",Marla West
534,2018-12-25T20:00:01+0000,An Early Goodbye to My Family,"She said she understood why we couldn’t spend Christmas together. I sent her so many “I miss you” texts. “Your parents will come around someday,” she replied. She spent the day alone in our apartment, not texting me much so I wouldn’t sense her sadness. I sensed it anyway. So I said an early goodbye to my family in Kentucky and drove seven and a half hours back to Iowa, arriving in time to sleep next to her under our string lights. That is when I learned what really matters on a day like Christmas: being around the person you love most. — Amanda Hancock",Amanda Hancock
535,2018-12-25T20:00:01+0000,He Won’t Say the ‘L’ Word,"The first Christmas we were newly dating, and I was sure we would be madly in love soon. The second Christmas came during our relationship low: I was disappointed that we had never used the “L” word. I became obsessed with this “saying ‘I love you’ thing,” measuring our relationship against its nonexistence, certain I would not bring him, absent those words, to a third Christmas at my parents’ home. But I could not abide by my own ultimatum. I don’t want to be without him. If you’re reading this, Nick, I love you. — Tara Wilson",Tara Wilson
536,2018-12-25T20:00:01+0000,Memories in a Box,"At home over winter break, I open the box of relics from my first relationship. There are sheafs of handwritten notes, handpicked flowers painted gold, Christmas songs and brass trumpets and photos of high schoolers resplendent in red and green polo shirts, standing among fake Christmas trees and cotton-ball snow. I read through love letters signed with hopeful endings, sonnets expressing feelings that we were not ready to express ourselves. Sitting in my childhood room, I marvel at these precious memories flooding back. This, in itself, is a gift. — Marissa Young",Marissa Young
537,2018-12-18T19:15:55+0000,Trying Not to Love You,"So far away from each other. An ocean and 20 years between us. “I love you, but we need to end whatever this is,” she says. She may be right: We discuss the power imbalance of an older man and a younger woman, the age gap between her and my grown children. Months later we are in the same city again for a day. It doesn’t take a day. Not even a minute. Just a smile and we are back where we started. In love, happy and confused. Confused because we’re trying to fall in love with other people. And it isn’t working. — Nick Williamson",Nick Williamson
538,2018-12-18T19:15:55+0000,For Reza,"I believed that if I did a good enough job acting in his play, I could will my beloved director, Reza Abdoh, not to die. Even though Reza was emaciated, his legs spattered with sarcoma lesions, he still seemed like someone who could scare off death: He had defied AIDS all the years I had been acting in his experimental plays. But when we actors assembled for the first rehearsal of his new play, we learned that he had been placed on life support. I had lost my chance. Or had I? Every play I have done in the two decades since has secretly been for him. — Juliana Francis-Kelly",Juliana Francis-Kelly
539,2018-12-18T19:15:55+0000,FaceTiming Through the Storm,"We met on Tinder while stuck at home during Hurricane Harvey. With nothing to do for three days but wait, we started messaging, then FaceTiming. Houston looked like a lake. But he said he had a truck and could pick me up. We risked it, traveling to Outback Steakhouse, one of the few restaurants open. Judging it too dangerous to drive home, we stayed at my cousin’s house near the restaurant. He left the Navy for us, and nine months after the hurricane, we exchanged vows, becoming husband and husband. — Oliver Perrett",Oliver Perrett
540,2018-12-18T19:15:55+0000,"Out of the Dark, Into the Sea","When the love of my life died of a heroin overdose, I believed love had left my life for good. Then I met Daniel. It was everything I didn’t think was going to work until late one night when he showed me where to find coyotes hiding in the San Francisco hills. His visa was expiring, so we got married at City Hall and celebrated with a giant cake from our local bakery. This love is not high drama, but the love for our baby boy is. Perhaps my boyfriend’s death was the tragedy that allowed me to know the sound of my son’s voice touching the sea. — Molly Welton",Molly Welton
541,2018-12-18T19:15:55+0000,"Grandpa, I’m on the Toilet","My grandfather has dementia. When I was visiting, he barged into the bathroom to give me a newspaper clipping: an article about a boy who programmed robotic hands to play the piano. I guess he didn’t remember that it is not O.K. to walk in on someone on the toilet, but he did remember that the piano is my favorite instrument. There are a lot of things we forget, I’m sure, but I don’t think we ever really forget how to love each other. — Bella O’Connor",Bella O’Connor
542,2018-12-11T17:19:36+0000,Electric Blue Eyes,"He was a senior with electric blue eyes. I was a sophomore with a crush. Introductions turned into lunch, then into a college romance. We were untouchable. But nights squeezed into my dorm bed turned into breakups and “I can’t live without you” reunions. My senior year, two pink lines. He pawned his Martin guitar for a ring and sold his Jeep for a security deposit on a tiny Baltimore rowhouse. I walked across the graduation stage 6 months pregnant. None of it has been perfect. But you know what is? The way our little boy looks at us with the same blue eyes. — Elizabeth Mackey",Elizabeth Mackey
543,2018-12-11T17:19:36+0000,A Rescue Cat Rescued Me,"I met my cat, Talula, on a cold night in 2004 when I was too broke to take Amtrak and too sick to eat dinner. She had been hit by a car but saved by a friend. I was dying from anorexia. I took New Jersey Transit to Philadelphia to pick her up, and I kept her warm with a sweater and sang to her the whole ride home. In New York she slept on my head, sat on my lap and helped me recover. It took 14 years. — Rena Silverman",Rena Silverman
544,2018-12-11T17:19:36+0000,Climbing Mount Fuji,"Huddled several kilometers up Mount Fuji, on a journey harder than we anticipated, Jeff looked into my eyes, which were blurry from crying, and said, “I wonder how many American Express points it would take to have a helicopter pick us up.” Both of us exploded in laughter and tears. I dusted dirt off my body as he extended his hand and pulled me up. We continue up and down our mountain daily, in darkness and light, taking turns being the hand held out and the hand that needs lifting to keep moving forward. — Carrie Ferguson",Carrie Ferguson
545,2018-12-04T20:46:46+0000,Coming Out to My Son,"I said to my 12-year-old son, “You know how men and women date and marry, like I did with Dad before we split up?” He nodded. “Well,” I said, “I’m dating someone but not a man; I’m dating a woman.” He said, “Are you happy?” “Yes,” I said, “Very happy.” “Cool,” he said, “then I’m happy.” A few years later he walked me down the aisle to my soon-to-be wife. — Carrie Platner",Carrie Platner
546,2018-12-04T20:46:46+0000,I Slapped Him Hard,"I was working as a bartender and waitress at BBR (“Burgers, Beer and Rock 'n' Roll”). He was watching a Duke basketball game with his friends. When I came over, his friends begged me to slap him. Apparently, he had lost a bet, a slap bet. I asked my boss if I could slap this cute customer. My boss said yes. So I slapped him hard on his left cheek, and it must have been an amazing slap because here we are madly in love four years later. — Laura Pomales",Laura Pomales
547,2018-12-04T20:46:46+0000,When Love Is a Recipe,"Chopped celery and squared potatoes waiting in the fridge. On the counter, a jug of water and a slow-cooker filled with dried peas. On the lid, a tiny note from my husband, the professional chef, to me, who burns water. “At noonish: 1. Add water 2. Add veggies 3. Stir 4. Plug in 5. Forget.” His sweetly crooked handwriting. His unconditional faith in me. Between steps 4 and 5, it hit me. Married love is seldom about the grand gesture. Sometimes it simply shows up as a recipe from your partner, helping you make a tasty pot of soup. — Meagan Fratiello",Meagan Fratiello
548,2018-11-27T20:12:46+0000,“I Miss Daddy”,"My longhaired 5-year-old came back from the weekend at his father’s house wearing his father’s hat. He wouldn’t take it off. “I miss daddy,” he said. There were no tears. No tantrums. No whining. He stated the facts. It just was, and he accepted it. I wondered at my son’s strength, at his heartache. My parents aren’t divorced. I don’t know what it’s like. That night he fell asleep sucking his thumb and wearing his father’s hat. — Amy Okura",Amy Okura
549,2018-11-27T20:12:46+0000,The Power of Bitmoji,"Once upon a time, my partner sent me a sweet text while I was home caring for our baby. Seeing his Bitmoji avatar elicited an oxytocin surge so strong that my postpartum milk let down. If that’s not an expression of love, I don’t know what is. — Jenn Clifford",Jenn Clifford
550,2018-11-27T20:12:46+0000,A Terrible Idea That Works,"I was 18, a privileged English girl in Georgia for the summer. I had dropped out of high school and was jumping from one minimum wage job to the next. She was 46, a Sunday school-teaching Southerner who was going to save my soul for Jesus. We met riding horses and fell in love by accident, without realizing what was happening until it was too late. Now we’re married. I’m an Ivy League professor and she’s retired. Our daughter is 15. After 26 years, it’s still a terrible idea, but it works. — Rose Nolen-Walston",Rose Nolen-Walston
551,2018-11-20T17:56:17+0000,Things Tinder Dates Offered Me,"Some things Tinder dates offered me (that are not sex): jars of jam, help hanging shelves, a ride to the airport, hangover sundae with peanuts, shortcuts across Durham, Costco visits, a planning commissioner’s phone number, a medical consultation, a visit to a Georgia O’Keeffe exhibit, sympathy, homemade pumpkin bread, stories about their mothers, the best swimming holes, long hugs that stay hugs. I thought online dating would be about physical need, but instead I’ve experienced so many small intimacies. Still about need. Almost about love. — Sarah Morris",Sarah Morris
552,2018-11-20T17:56:17+0000,Searching for Self-Love,"Throughout my hardships with obsessive-compulsive disorder, parents, boyfriends and social media celebrities have sent me on a frantic and mostly unsuccessful search for self-love. I have tried to exude self-love in its various costumes — a perfect Instagram, an overflowing social calendar, a forced smile at the office. Yet these outward expressions aren’t enough in the quiet moments when worry and doubt creep in. When all seems lost during solitary train rides home, my greatest triumph is finding the courage to whisper, “It’s all right. I’ll get through this. I love you,” and boarding the train again. — M.C. Connors",M.C. Connors
553,2018-11-20T17:56:17+0000,"I Said, “I Love You.” He Said, “Thanks.”","We were in my hammock when I looked at the socks I was wearing, the ones he had lent me, and told him the words I was so scared to say: “I love you.” The hammock swayed, crickets chirped. “Thanks,” he said, “but I don’t yet.” He pointed at my feet. “Those don’t fit me. Do you want them?” I thought the hammock had tipped, thrown me violently out; he didn’t love me, this was it. But years later, we still lie in my hammock and I still wear those socks. He was right; they are too small for his feet. — Madeleine Fawcett",Madeleine Fawcett
554,2018-11-13T19:51:45+0000,Married Marines,"We locked eyes across a crowded room. He was handsome in his military uniform; I was self-conscious in mine. Colleagues at first, he earned my respect, friendship and, finally, my heart and life. Years later, he faded away and she appeared. We picked out a new name for her and shared wardrobes, sorrows and joys — and passion, as I fell in love with her graceful curves. I was mesmerized by the way she moved, black curls tumbling over her shoulders. My husband gone, now my wife holds my whole heart in her hands. — Jacqueline Keavney Lader",Jacqueline Keavney Lader
555,2018-11-13T19:51:45+0000,Off the Curb,"I had been kicked to the curb at 52. Took that as an omen. No more love for me and no point even looking. Then I sat down at a New Year’s Eve party in the only empty chair in the room, a guy sitting beside me. Struck up a conversation, which was only polite, about our children — heads close together, given the noise. We have been talking now for 10 years, heads close together. Lesson learned: Be open. — Susan Lightstone",Susan Lightstone
556,2018-11-13T19:51:45+0000,“Holiest of Communions”,"She no longer wore her thick glasses, her eyes watery and unsure. She could no longer feed herself. When we visited, my son, Mathias, fed her puréed vegetables a spoonful at a time. My tiny daughter, Christina, watched, then squeezed in between her brother and her grandma. First, Christina planted a kiss, the noisy, juicy kind Grandma used to give her. They giggled. Then Christina tore off a piece of soft bread and placed it on her grandma’s tongue. Ma accepted it and swallowed. The sadness lifted. For me, it was the holiest of communions. — Joyce Simon",Joyce Simon
557,2018-11-06T18:04:04+0000,“Way Before ‘La La Land’”,"It was way too early to be awake but I had a long commute from Tujunga to Marina del Rey. The 405 was stopped (this was way before ‘La La Land’). Suddenly, the driver door of the car directly in front of my Toyota swung open. The man I had gone out with for the first time the night before emerged and walked toward me. He kissed me through my window then strolled back to his car. Traffic began to move. Now we are both old and married forever. But the memory holds. — Peg Burr",Peg Burr
558,2018-11-06T18:04:04+0000,"2,800 Miles Close Together","People don’t often associate the sound of snores with love, but I do. People don’t often associate technology with love, but I do. To me, love is the sound of my mother’s breathing over the course of a six-hour FaceTime call. I was 21 and alone in Mexico. I told her that I was woken by a man who had tried to break into my room. She listened, then calmly said, “I am here. I am too exhausted to stay up all night, but I am here.” She slept next to me from 2,800 miles away. — Lucy Putnam",Lucy Putnam
559,2018-11-06T18:04:04+0000,A Human Connection,"Two officers transported me from Elmira Correctional Facility to a cardiologist’s office in town. I waddled into the exam room wearing ankle cuffs, wrists shackled. A nurse entered. I felt like an animal outside its cage, unshowered and raw, but she smiled anyway. She made eye contact, even shook my hand before pressing a stethoscope to my battered heart. We were close enough to hear each other breathe. After a few precious seconds of small talk, she tapped my ankle cuffs with two fingers and said, “You’re smarter than this.” I was too choked up to ask her name. — Michael Fischer",Michael Fischer
560,2018-10-30T17:30:24+0000,Dogs on Instagram,"It was a typical New York City love story: We met playing kickball, bonded over jazz and fantasy football and dog runs. We were together for a year, but Astoria is far from the Upper West Side. Weeknights became weekends became every other weekend. We split up after the Halloween dog parade, both agreeing that it just fizzled. Yet, three years later, we still talk every day. But only trading cute dog photos on Instagram. Pugs, Brussels Griffons and Frenchies exclusively. It’s one of my most cherished friendships. — Ricardo Screpka",Ricardo Screpka
561,2018-10-30T17:30:24+0000,“No More Secrets”,"My grandmother never employed female pronouns when asking if I had found someone. She used the Spanish neutral pronouns to find out if that “someone” had arrived, if I was willing to introduce her to the person I love. She never asked me if I was gay, but she didn’t doubt it because she knew me better than anyone else. She took her silence to the grave, and now I face her gravestone with the boy she will never meet. Granny, today homosexuality is still taboo in Peru, but at least there are no more secrets between us. — Marco Huarancca",Marco Huarancca
562,2018-10-30T17:30:24+0000,“The Storm Is Taking It All”,"The winds of Hurricane Maria were barreling down our street in the mountain town of Cayey, Puerto Rico. The windows in my parents’ bedroom began to shake. My mother left the room quickly, but my father froze. “I can’t move,” he said. “The storm is taking it all.” My two siblings and I entered. We told him he needed to get out. “I can’t,” he said with a blank stare. We hugged him hard while the windows rattled, threatening to break loose. “Te tenemos, papi,” we said. (“We got you, Dad.”) He looked up at us and started walking. — Melissa Alvarado Sierra",Melissa Alvarado Sierra
563,2018-10-23T20:04:33+0000,“Not Done With the World”,"After five rounds of in vitro fertilization, my wife and I didn’t have the funds to be parents anymore. We cried all the time. Avoided Facebook. Held our dogs too tight. Watched baby elephant videos. To escape the wormhole of grief, we bought tickets to Prague we could barely afford. Our sadness flickered like a ghost. In Old Town, we smiled. Licked the rain from each other's lips. Kissed on Charles Bridge. Wrote graffiti declaring our love. Held hands on the tram. Ate soup that warmed our bones. We were not done with the world. — Jackson Bliss",Jackson Bliss
564,2018-10-23T20:04:33+0000,Separate Vacations,"He took a boat. I stayed home. Married 41 years, we don’t mind going our separate ways. Later he told me stories about the Canadian lake, a cedar boat, the fish he gently let go. They swam away, their tails flipping him off. I wrote a tiny story about his love of nature. It began: He took a boat. It ended: We are happy when alone together. — Beverly Blasingame",Beverly Blasingame
